Plant a seed and water it everyday.</br>
Some seeds don't germinate, so</br>
plant more.</br>
(I feel good today. I feel the high but my feet feel the abyss I'm re-approaching.</br>
I'm scared of falling again from these high heights.)
</p>

<p>
  <strong>10/18/2017</strong></br>
He's gone.</br>
Like everyone else,</br>
he's gone.</br>
I gave him my email just in case he needed me.</br>
He won't need me. This I know.</br>
Waited for his final response to my final response literally all night.</br>
I didn't sleep. I slept in, missing all my classes.</br>
Maybe that was dumb. But I did it.</br>
It's midterm break and everyone has deserted campus.</br>
Even my roommate. I'm so relieved to have this space all to myself.<br>
Finally.</br>
I feel like he never really wanted to change this or put in more effort.<br>
I was a guaranteed stock. He wasn't required to do much.</br>
But that was the fucking point.</br>
You have the option to show how much you care.</br>
And you cared so little, I had to pretend you really did.</br>
What else can I say to you after this?</br>
As soon as I brought up disbanding,</br>
You were already a mile away.</br>
How do you live life hurting people?</br>
No warning or anything. You just take what you want and get out.</br>
Don't say you're guilty when you keep doing it.</br>
One day, things will flip.</br>
You'll be the one hurt and confused</br>
Not by me, but by someone you trusted.</br>
so much it might kill you..</br>
Everything comes full circle.</br>
I just wish you would understand.
</p>

  <strong>10/18/2017 Nighttime</strong></br>
  I want to kill myself.</br>
I feel like suicide is the only option. I've tried, I've tried.</br>
But I can't keep trying and crying all the time.</br>
My life has been nothing but pain. In all areas, there's mostly painful memories.</br>
Molested by Henry's friend when I was about 5. He'd slap me around afterwards.</br>
Thought it was love in a way.</br>
Isolated by momma.</br>
Brian beating us, beating our mom, beating Henry with a sword that night</br>
It's too much for one person.</br>
Feeling manipulated by my mom. Feeling so sheltered.</br>
I felt like the world was this scary place that only had bad intentions.</br>
I was ashamed of my family. I was ashamed of myself.</br>
I didn't go to friends' birthday parties.</br>
I want to make up these great memories my mom keeps trying to make seem real.</br>
Dad hit me and busted my lip on holloween.</br>
I had to leave a year later as a homeless kid.</br>
Friends at school were few. I turned to online.</br>
And even then, I knew I wasn't worth much to those people.</br>
Not to James, not to Des, not to Dianna, not to Sara, not to Tea,</br>
Not Sora, not Luke, not Katrina, not Rayne, Jake, Shanti..</br>
Not Aidan. Not Lasha. Not Alek. Not Matthew.</br>
they disappeared.</br>
I'm tired of crying. I'm tired of rejection. I'm tired of feeling worthless.</br>
I'm tired, I'm tired.</br>
I'm just ready to die. I don't want to be here anymore.</br>
It'll just be a life of pain.</br>
They're all gone. Family. They don't understand. They don't help.</br>
They just hurt and blame.</br>
Tough love is not what I need right now. I give myself enough of that.</br>
I'm tired, I'm tired.</br>
I hate school. I hate Truman. I hate this. I hate this life. I hate this.</br>
I can't stop thinking of killing myself.</br>
I just want to sleep forever.</br>
I can't keep waking up in this body.</br>
I can't do this. I can't do this alone</br>
But I have no one. They're gone.</br>
I'm alone now.</br>
I just need the courage. Some weed to loosen me up like that night with Ten.</br>
I want to die like Taylor Wheat.</br>
I want to join my grandmother.</br>
Kill me.. Please. Kill me. End this.</br>
I have no one... no one...
</p>
<p>
  <strong>10/19/2017 1:47am</strong></br>
I meant all of that above.</br>
I want this pain to be over.</br>
No one will ever see this, so I can be honest here.</br>
I wish someone could see this and save me.</br>
I think it's cute that I always talk about helping people in similar mindsets</br>
But in reality, I'm hoping someone will see I'm talking about me.</br>
So far, no takers.</br>
Can I be angry at the world?</br>
Because I am. I hate this place. I fucking hate everyone.</br>
They charm. They take. They cripple. They leave.</br>
I hate this world. I don't care if I don't understand it.</br>
I hate this world. I hate living here. I hate feeling so alien.</br>
I'm ugly, black, short, and fat. My genes are unlucky.</br>
My brain is big and taxing. My energy is exhausted easily, socially and physically.</br>
I think that types like me weren't meant to make it in the world/wild.</br>
We're below everyone else. We're meant to die off.</br>
But here I am. Breathing and typing. My tears are drying to my face.</br>
I'm tired but I'm afraid to get off this keyboard.</br>
I'm afraid I'll have to face myself and my loneliness all alone all over again.</br>
I need distractions. So, I'll watch Dashie, since he makes me laugh.</br>
And I'll try to fall asleep before I notice.</br>
</br>
I deleted kik, so I don't know if Aidan ever messaged me back.</br>
I guess I'll find out later.</br>
I don't even feel like I'm living for later.</br>
It's hard enough to exist in this moment.</br>
Is this how my hermit crabs felt when they commited suicide one by one?</br>
Such terrible cold conditions. They started leaving their shells, dying.</br>
They were that desperate to ease their discomfort.</br>
And I feel that. I feel that.</br>
Lisa is so relatable.

Hi.</br>
I'm sitting here at my laptop.</br>
Light blue dress that comes to my ankles and buttons up.</br>
Short sleeves. Looks nice on me.</br>
I have a black jacket on. Michael's jacket. A bit bigger but not much.</br>
I'm a fat girl. I'm a short girl. I'm confused about things.</br>
I try to feel pretty but I don't feel pretty.</br>
I want to change though. Before I go through with any suicide,</br>
I want to at least feel beautiful.</br>
And at the end of that journey, if I still feel miserable,</br>
I then know that none of this was avoidable. That my feelings are chronic.</br>
I slept in until around 4pm. Wow.</br>
I haven't wasted that much time in one sitting before.</br>
I think about him. I do. I read my messages that I screenshot.</br>
I think of things I should have said instead or worded differently.</br>
I wonder how he's taking those messages. If this even bothers him.</br>
If this is hurting him as much as it hurts me.</br>
And I don't know would would feel better.</br>
To know this is hurting him or that he's okay?</br>
It's selfish, I know.</br>
But the yearn for validation can be so strong.</br>
I feel numb but okay. I think.</br>
I tried to hate the world, but I don't hate it.</br>
I tried to think tough thoughts, to be strong.</br>
I don't feel very strong. I feel numb.</br>
I got some Dairy Queen. That's all I ate today.</br>
I don't feel fat, but it was still fattening.</br>
I watched a little bit of old 2013 Dashie vids.</br>
I played two games from <a href="https://itch.io">Itch.o</a></br>
<a href="https://zephyo.itch.io/i-woke-up">I woke up next to you again</a></br>
And <a href="https://the-quinnspiracy.itch.io/depressionquest">Depression Quest</a></br>
The first game was really short.</br>
Probably took me 30 minutes to see all the endings.</br>
Depression Quest, however, took me forever.</br>
I just finished it before this post.</br>
Made me think of him. Maybe that's how he felt.</br>
Guilty, sad, and de-energized all the time.</br>
It made me think about my choice of words in that final message.</br>
I felt regret.</br>
But the choice still remains. I had to leave.</br>
Two sad people can't lift each other out of the wilderness.</br>
It's too fucking hard. Too much. Too fast.</br>
But I hope my email served some purpose. I check it.</br>
In the back of my mind, I'm stuffing down the hope</br>
that he does end up needing me and reaching out.</br>
It bubbles up inside me and I'm popping the hope as it comes.</br>
Hopelessness or constant disappointment?</br>
I don't know.</br>
</br>
No one reads this. I can be honest here.</br>
I have to keep reminding myself.</br>
I'm scared to be found out.</br>
But no one will find this. I'm a ghost.</br<
Stranded and forgotten.</br>
No one will see this. Be honest.</br>
I have to relax. For once, I have to relax.</br>
Have to trust this medium of expression</br>
since I don't have anything as useful.</br>
I have therapy tomorrow at 11am.</br>
I don't really like my therapist. He gets me so wrong.</br>
I cried in his office and he just stared right through me.</br>
I know they're probably use to people crying, but I don't know.</br>
I felt unseen?</br>
So, that's that. I will keep going though. I need appointments.</br>
They keep me on some sort of accountability schedule.</br>
Plus, venting is always good.</br>
When I see him, I'm going to tell him</br>
that I no longer want to discuss my social difficulties.</br>
I want to focus on getting over my past.</br>
Getting comfortable with who I am.</br>
I want to focus on myself. I'm not ready for people.</br>
I can't focus on the world anymore.</br>
Dad even said it once:</br>
"Stop trying to understand people all the time. Understand yourself."</br>
I use psychology and good observation to</br>
monitor others in a way, I guess.</br>
But that's to avoid myself?</br>
I need to stop worrying about others.</br>
I need to get comfortable with myself.</br>
As he said, put myself first.</br>
Even in the end, he let me down gently.</br>
</br>
I wrote something on my phone this morning too.</br>
It was during that long sleep. </br>
I had woken up around 12 and started typing this sort of manifesto.</br>
It was about.. well, all of this. </br>
I'd have to copy and paste it here sometime.</br>
I really liked it.</br>
The main takeaway I got was that</br>
I need to take this life one day at a time.</br>
Get over Aidan one day at a time.</br>
Get over what my family has done to me one day at a time.</br>
Go to tutoring. Go to class. One day at a time.</br>
Commit to my diet one day a time.</br>
Commit to consistent hygiene one day at a time.</br>
Speaking of which, I need to shower.</br>
God, the residence halls are so empty. </br>
It's fucking bliss walking through the hallways.</br>
My roommate got a letter slid in under our door.</br>
She was nominated SA.</br>
I'm thinking of shredding it and playing dumb.</br>
It feels so good but it's so bad.</br>
It doesn't feel bad but to the person who finds this</br>
and is reading, maybe they think it's bad.</br>
But I want to do it.</br>
I snooped through her belongings.</br>
I read her shitty writing.</br>
I laid in her bed.</br>
So, that's what the other side feels like?</br>
Parents sending you letters of love and encouragement.</br>
Drawings from friends on your desk.</br>
Coffee mugs and fedoras. Pictures of recognizable people.</br>
Money. Lesbian books. Desk lamps.</br>
I'm shredding that fucking letter.</br>
Am I jealous? Is this jealously? I don't want to admit it.</br>
I feel something though.</br>
And it feels so good burning lightly in my chest.</br>
I don't want her to hurt like me. No, that's not what's going on.</br>
But having control over someone else's life feels good.</br>
To be on other side, for a change, feels good.</br>
And I'll do it amorally. With small traces of shame and guilt.</br>
But I'll do it.</br>
Anyway, I need to take that shower. My head hurts. I feel stupid.
