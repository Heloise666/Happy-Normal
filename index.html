    <strong>10/16/2017</strong></br>
Plant a seed and water it everyday.</br>
Some seeds don't germinate, so</br>
plant more.</br>
(I feel good today. I feel the high but my feet feel the abyss I'm re-approaching.</br>
I'm scared of falling again from these high heights.)
</p>

<p>
  <strong>10/18/2017</strong></br>
He's gone.</br>
Like everyone else,</br>
he's gone.</br>
I gave him my email just in case he needed me.</br>
He won't need me. This I know.</br>
Waited for his final response to my final response literally all night.</br>
I didn't sleep. I slept in, missing all my classes.</br>
Maybe that was dumb. But I did it.</br>
It's midterm break and everyone has deserted campus.</br>
Even my roommate. I'm so relieved to have this space all to myself.<br>
Finally.</br>
I feel like he never really wanted to change this or put in more effort.<br>
I was a guaranteed stock. He wasn't required to do much.</br>
But that was the fucking point.</br>
You have the option to show how much you care.</br>
And you cared so little, I had to pretend you really did.</br>
What else can I say to you after this?</br>
As soon as I brought up disbanding,</br>
You were already a mile away.</br>
How do you live life hurting people?</br>
No warning or anything. You just take what you want and get out.</br>
Don't say you're guilty when you keep doing it.</br>
One day, things will flip.</br>
You'll be the one hurt and confused</br>
Not by me, but by someone you trusted.</br>
so much it might kill you..</br>
Everything comes full circle.</br>
I just wish you would understand.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>10/18/2017 Nighttime</strong></br>
  I want to kill myself.</br>
I feel like suicide is the only option. I've tried, I've tried.</br>
But I can't keep trying and crying all the time.</br>
My life has been nothing but pain. In all areas, there's mostly painful memories.</br>
Molested by Henry's friend when I was about 5. He'd slap me around afterwards.</br>
Thought it was love in a way.</br>
Isolated by momma.</br>
Brian beating us, beating our mom, beating Henry with a sword that night</br>
It's too much for one person.</br>
Feeling manipulated by my mom. Feeling so sheltered.</br>
I felt like the world was this scary place that only had bad intentions.</br>
I was ashamed of my family. I was ashamed of myself.</br>
I didn't go to friends' birthday parties.</br>
I want to make up these great memories my mom keeps trying to make seem real.</br>
Dad hit me and busted my lip on holloween.</br>
I had to leave a year later as a homeless kid.</br>
Friends at school were few. I turned to online.</br>
And even then, I knew I wasn't worth much to those people.</br>
Not to James, not to Des, not to Dianna, not to Sara, not to Tea,</br>
Not Sora, not Luke, not Katrina, not Rayne, Jake, Shanti..</br>
Not Aidan. Not Lasha. Not Alek. Not Matthew.</br>
they disappeared.</br>
I'm tired of crying. I'm tired of rejection. I'm tired of feeling worthless.</br>
I'm tired, I'm tired.</br>
I'm just ready to die. I don't want to be here anymore.</br>
It'll just be a life of pain.</br>
They're all gone. Family. They don't understand. They don't help.</br>
They just hurt and blame.</br>
Tough love is not what I need right now. I give myself enough of that.</br>
I'm tired, I'm tired.</br>
I hate school. I hate Truman. I hate this. I hate this life. I hate this.</br>
I can't stop thinking of killing myself.</br>
I just want to sleep forever.</br>
I can't keep waking up in this body.</br>
I can't do this. I can't do this alone</br>
But I have no one. They're gone.</br>
I'm alone now.</br>
I just need the courage. Some weed to loosen me up like that night with Ten.</br>
I want to die like Taylor Wheat.</br>
I want to join my grandmother.</br>
Kill me.. Please. Kill me. End this.</br>
I have no one... no one...
</p>
<p>
  <strong>10/19/2017 1:47am</strong></br>
I meant all of that above.</br>
I want this pain to be over.</br>
No one will ever see this, so I can be honest here.</br>
I wish someone could see this and save me.</br>
I think it's cute that I always talk about helping people in similar mindsets</br>
But in reality, I'm hoping someone will see I'm talking about me.</br>
So far, no takers.</br>
Can I be angry at the world?</br>
Because I am. I hate this place. I fucking hate everyone.</br>
They charm. They take. They cripple. They leave.</br>
I hate this world. I don't care if I don't understand it.</br>
I hate this world. I hate living here. I hate feeling so alien.</br>
I'm ugly, black, short, and fat. My genes are unlucky.</br>
My brain is big and taxing.</br>
My energy is exhausted easily, socially and physically.</br>
I think that types like me weren't meant to make it in the world/wild.</br>
We're below everyone else. We're meant to die off.</br>
But here I am. Breathing and typing. My tears are drying to my face.</br>
I'm tired but I'm afraid to get off this keyboard.</br>
I'm afraid I'll have to face myself and my loneliness all alone all over again.</br>
I need distractions. So, I'll watch Dashie, since he makes me laugh.</br>
And I'll try to fall asleep before I notice.</br>
</br>
I deleted kik, so I don't know if Aidan ever messaged me back.</br>
I guess I'll find out later.</br>
I don't even feel like I'm living for later.</br>
It's hard enough to exist in this moment.</br>
Is this how my hermit crabs felt when they commited suicide one by one?</br>
Such terrible cold conditions. They started leaving their shells, dying.</br>
They were that desperate to ease their discomfort.</br>
And I feel that. I feel that.</br>
Lisa is so relatable.
</p>

  <strong>10/19/2017 9:49pm</strong></br>
Hi.</br>
I'm sitting here at my laptop.</br>
Light blue dress that comes to my ankles and buttons up.</br>
Short sleeves. Looks nice on me.</br>
I have a black jacket on. Michael's jacket. A bit bigger but not much.</br>
I'm a fat girl. I'm a short girl. I'm confused about things.</br>
I try to feel pretty but I don't feel pretty.</br>
I want to change though. Before I go through with any suicide,</br>
I want to at least feel beautiful.</br>
And at the end of that journey, if I still feel miserable,</br>
I then know that none of this was avoidable. That my feelings are chronic.</br>
I slept in until around 4pm. Wow.</br>
I haven't wasted that much time in one sitting before.</br>
I think about him. I do. I read my messages that I screenshot.</br>
I think of things I should have said instead or worded differently.</br>
I wonder how he's taking those messages. If this even bothers him.</br>
If this is hurting him as much as it hurts me.</br>
And I don't know what would feel better.</br>
To know this is hurting him or that he's okay?</br>
It's selfish, I know.</br>
But the yearn for validation can be so strong.</br>
I feel numb but okay. I think.</br>
I tried to hate the world, but I don't hate it.</br>
I tried to think tough thoughts, to be strong.</br>
I don't feel very strong. I feel numb.</br>
I got some Dairy Queen. That's all I ate today.</br>
I don't feel fat, but it was still fattening.</br>
I watched a little bit of old 2013 Dashie vids.</br>
I played two games from <a href="https://itch.io">Itch.o</a></br>
<a href="https://zephyo.itch.io/i-woke-up">I woke up next to you again</a></br>
And <a href="https://the-quinnspiracy.itch.io/depressionquest">Depression Quest</a></br>
The first game was really short.</br>
Probably took me 30 minutes to see all the endings.</br>
Depression Quest, however, took me forever.</br>
I just finished it before this post.</br>
Made me think of him. Maybe that's how he felt.</br>
Guilty, sad, and de-energized all the time.</br>
It made me think about my choice of words in that final message.</br>
I felt regret.</br>
But the choice still remains. I had to leave.</br>
Two sad people can't lift each other out of the wilderness.</br>
It's too fucking hard. Too much. Too fast.</br>
But I hope my email served some purpose. I check it.</br>
In the back of my mind, I'm stuffing down the hope</br>
that he does end up needing me and reaching out.</br>
It bubbles up inside me and I'm popping the hope as it comes.</br>
Hopelessness or constant disappointment?</br>
I don't know.</br>
</br>
No one reads this. I can be honest here.</br>
I have to keep reminding myself.</br>
I'm scared to be found out.</br>
But no one will find this. I'm a ghost.</br<
Stranded and forgotten.</br>
No one will see this. Be honest.</br>
I have to relax. For once, I have to relax.</br>
Have to trust this medium of expression</br>
since I don't have anything as useful.</br>
I have therapy tomorrow at 11am.</br>
I don't really like my therapist. He gets me so wrong.</br>
I cried in his office and he just stared right through me.</br>
I know they're probably use to people crying, but I don't know.</br>
I felt unseen?</br>
So, that's that. I will keep going though. I need appointments.</br>
They keep me on some sort of accountability schedule.</br>
Plus, venting is always good.</br>
When I see him, I'm going to tell him</br>
that I no longer want to discuss my social difficulties.</br>
I want to focus on getting over my past.</br>
Getting comfortable with who I am.</br>
I want to focus on myself. I'm not ready for people.</br>
I can't focus on the world anymore.</br>
Dad even said it once:</br>
"Stop trying to understand people all the time. Understand yourself."</br>
I use psychology and good observation to</br>
monitor others in a way, I guess.</br>
But that's to avoid myself?</br>
I need to stop worrying about others.</br>
I need to get comfortable with myself.</br>
As he said, put myself first.</br>
Even in the end, he let me down gently.</br>
</br>
I wrote something on my phone this morning too.</br>
It was during that long sleep. </br>
I had woken up around 12 and started typing this sort of manifesto.</br>
It was about.. well, all of this. </br>
I'd have to copy and paste it here sometime.</br>
I really liked it.</br>
The main takeaway I got was that</br>
I need to take this life one day at a time.</br>
Get over Aidan one day at a time.</br>
Get over what my family has done to me one day at a time.</br>
Go to tutoring. Go to class. One day at a time.</br>
Commit to my diet one day a time.</br>
Commit to consistent hygiene one day at a time.</br>
Speaking of which, I need to shower.</br>
God, the residence halls are so empty. </br>
It's fucking bliss walking through the hallways.</br>
My roommate got a letter slid in under our door.</br>
She was nominated SA.</br>
I'm thinking of shredding it and playing dumb.</br>
It feels so good but it's so bad.</br>
It doesn't feel bad but to the person who finds this</br>
and is reading, maybe they think it's bad.</br>
But I want to do it.</br>
I snooped through her belongings.</br>
I read her shitty writing.</br>
I laid in her bed.</br>
So, that's what the other side feels like?</br>
Parents sending you letters of love and encouragement.</br>
Drawings from friends on your desk.</br>
Coffee mugs and fedoras. Pictures of recognizable people.</br>
Money. Lesbian books. Desk lamps.</br>
I'm shredding that fucking letter.</br>
Am I jealous? Is this jealously? I don't want to admit it.</br>
I feel something though.</br>
And it feels so good burning lightly in my chest.</br>
I don't want her to hurt like me. No, that's not what's going on.</br>
But having control over someone else's life feels good.</br>
To be on other side, for a change, feels good.</br>
And I'll do it amorally. With small traces of shame and guilt.</br>
But I'll do it.</br>
Anyway, I need to take that shower. My head hurts. I feel stupid.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>10/21/2017 1:42am</strong></br>
I don't want to live anymore</br>
Just want to fly fly fly fly away</br>
Ride high on the wings to paradise</br>
  Fly fly fly high and away
</p>
<p>
  Went to therapy like I promised myself.</br>
Felt good actually.</br>
I took it slow with him.</br>
He started talking about my loneliness and lack of friends.</br>
I said I didn't want to talk about that anymore.</br>
I wanted to talk about my past.</br>
I wanted to finally express all these memories.</br>
And we did that.</br>
I cried at some things. I managed through others.</br>
And it wasn't predictable either.</br>
The tears fell whenever like they were their own people.</br>
Dying on my face in that little office.</br>
Told him about Brian.</br>
Told him about moving constantly.</br>
Told him about Henry and that night.</br>
Told him about momma and feeling like I had to keep a low profile.</br>
Told him these little bits and peices about me.</br>
These things that seem so worthless to me in my head.</br>
But I think of them everyday?</br>
I guess these things are important to me after all.</br>
I'm coming out the closet, world.</br>
Believe it or not, I have a personality.</br>
I don't have to cower in a corner.</br>
Or be ashamed of myself.</br>
Just taking it one day at a time.</br>
The days matter.</br>
Can't keep sacrificing these days for the big picture.</br>
They make up the big picture.</br>
Just one day at a time.</br>
Slowly learning how to speak honestly.</br>
Slowly unlearning how to restrict myself from basic emotions.</br>
It's okay to be angry sometimes. To be jealous. To hate.</br>
It's okay to feel hurt, rejected, disrespected, and pathetic.</br>
My feelings won't go away because I ignore them.</br>
No matter how hard I push.</br>
They're still there, even farther out of my reach now.</br>
Just one day at a time.</br>
And when just getting through the day seems impossible,</br>
I'll take it one minute at a time. Just one minute.</br>
Breathe. I have to remember to breathe. To accept myself.</br>
My family and old friends aren't here anymore.</br>
I don't have to be what I think they want me to be anymore.</br>
My mask doesn't have to be removed now,</br>
but deconstructed.</br>
One peice at a time.</br>
As I go through metamorphosis,</br>
my mask, the caccoon, breaks slowly.</br>
Like an egg shell.</br>
</br>
I still check his Tumblr and IMVU page.</br>
I still wonder.</br>
I want to type answers here.</br>
I want to explain my behaviour with some wise insights</br>
and relevations. Offer some sense to my future self.</br>
But I don't know what to say.</br>
I just do what I do.</br>
There's no pure reason.</br>
And as terrifying (honestly) the unknown is for me,</br>
It's starting to surround me like</br>
family members at my death bed in a hospital.</br>
The unknown mourns my dying self.</br>
But I'm not dying.</br>
The hollowed closet I turned my being into is being torn down.</br>
To make room for the unknown me.</br>
I've been trying on these different personas</br>
Trying to figure out which fits best.</br>
Be cruel like a trap rapper? Heartless and money-oriented?</br>
Be cool, confused, beautiful, and young like Tame Impala and Lana Del Rey?</br>
Be a narcissistic robot like Marina and the Diamonds?</br>
Angry like Dance Gavin Dance?</br>
Powerful and confident like Beyonce?</br>
Soft and poetic like Imogen Heap and My Brightest Diamond?</br>
Who do I choose to become?</br>
I'm more lost than I like to admit.</br>
I like to seem in control.</br>
If I play like I'm well, I'll get well, right?</br>
These suicidal feelings are telling me that I'm wrong.</br>
And I don't like being wrong. Ever.</br>
Maybe I really am a know-it-all, like Ten said.</br>
Dad said the same.</br>
And here I am. Alone.</br>
I didn't take that shower last night.</br>
I continued trying to fix this site more.</br>
I'm satisfied for now.</br>
(Just typing the above scares me. I'm waiting for the worse now.)</br>
I had brown discharge this morning. Like blackish.</br>
My sides have been hurting for months.</br>
I don't have health insurance, so I don't want to get checked.</br>
But maybe I should at least find something to check me up.</br>
I don't want anymore pain.</br>
One last thing:</br>
I played Life is Strange, Before the Storm. Episode 2.</br>
Just finished before writing.</br>
Liked it a lot.</br>
Rachel Amber scares me admittingly though.</br>
I don't trust her.. I don't know.</br>
Stomach feels sick. Gotta go.</br>
</br>
Just one day at a time.</br>
That's all.
</p>
<p>
  Guess my personality type.
  That's right - INTJ!
  The loneliest of them all!
</p>
<p>
  <strong>10/23/2017 12:22am</strong></br>
Here I am.</br>
Sitting in my usual spot in my room.</br>
Fall break is officially over.</br>
I want to die already.</br>
My sleep is off. It's terrible.</br>
Dreams are still weird.</br>
Just because I declared a change</br>
doesn't mean a change will occur suddenly.</br>
It's all a long process.</br>
I feel sick. Sicker than normal.</br>
Like my stomach will erupt.</br>
I eat everything in one sitting and don't consume</br>
all my recommended calories.</br>
I ate like shit all week.</br>
I barely bathed.</br>
Didn't bother brushing my teeth.</br>
That felt liberating.</br>
But I'm going to change that.</br>
I'm taking a shower soon.</br>
Going to wear clean clothes for class.</br>
Going to be a good clean girl.</br>
</br>
I still feel ill.</br>
Both mentally and physically.</br>
My habits of overthinking,</br>
Being overly aware of others,</br>
Being unable to live in the moment</br>
Without my thoughts wandering endlessly</br>
Thinking of Aidan.</br>
It hurts to check his feeds</br>
But out of boredom and bad habits</br>
I still do.</br>
I miss him.</br>
I miss having a friend.</br>
Even if that friend disappeared for weeks.</br>
Tried to reassure myself.</br>
Would tell Ten that our bond was relaxed and special.</br>
We had freedom together.</br>
But that was a cover-up for the fact</br>
That he would leave without much consideration.</br>
And I would message him repeatedly for a response.</br>
Was he only my friend out of sympathy?</br>
A sympathetic shell - Aidan.</br>
Gone already a mile when I brought up leaving.</br>
He's been on IMVU.</br>
He hasn't responded to my messages on Kik,</br>
So, I deleted it.</br>
Another program I deleted because of hin.</br>
Mathew...</br>
Alek..</br>
They've all left me.</br>
And I'm all alone now.</br>
Feeling suicidal</br>
So dark and empty.</br>
Pretty canvas for makeup and music.</br>
Music, Youtube, writing the book, college -</br>
Only things I have now.</br>
Out of everything, the only things I own are the things I do myself.</br>
It hurts to feel nothing still.</br>
I'm hoping that things get better.</br>
I'm hoping this sad spirit leaves me alone.</br>
If sadness was a lover, we'd have a family together.</br>
And sadness would never cheat on me.</br>
No, sadness never strays. Always loyal. Always with me.</br>
Did you know that about 3000 people kill themselves each night in the US?</br>
I just researched that this morning.</br>
One day, I feel like I'll be in that group.</br>
At least I won't go to hell alone.</br>
</br>
Time for that shower.</br>
I'm sure my roommate is tired of my late night stirrings.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>10/25/2017 10:05pm</strong></br>
Here I am again.</br>
Another night of dirty dancing.</br>
I'm not dancing, just sitting.</br>
I went out for a walk.</br>
Needed that badly.</br>
Felt like my head was going to explode.</br>
My sides feel like they're burning.</br>
The pain is briefly lifted when I eat.</br>
How nice.</br>
My head still hurts.</br>
Suicide is still a lingering thought.</br>
I think of death every morning,</br>
Nearly every minute really.</br>
I feel bad.</br>
I feel scared.</br>
I feel like I'm going to do something</br>
stupid.</br>
But the thought of doing something</br>
is exciting enough for me.</br>
I'm ready to fuck up.</br>
I'm ready to smash, kill, and fail.</br>
I want to feel real pain</br>
That has real purpose and meaning.</br>
All this pain is meaningless, boring, gloomy, and deep.</br>
Cuts me like a slow knife.</br>
Just take a chainsaw to my jaw.</br>
Just fucking do it already, fuck.</br>
I'm so hurt, so numb</br>
I don't want to be special or golden.</br>
Special like a mentally retarded child.</br>
Golden like a shower.</br>
Pointless little ant - me.</br>
One out of 7.4 billion.</br>
All these beautiful people.</br>
And their beautiful problems.</br>
My words spill and mix like cereal and milk.</br>
The cafeteria doesn't serve cookie crisps anymore.</br>
I have to eat fruitloops or cheerios now.</br>
A blank bowl stares back at me while I eat.</br>
And all that chatter pitter patter blows right past me.</br>
And I don't care about the blurry faces anymore.</br>
Some girl died from my college.</br>
I saw the email. That girl is super dead.</br>
Could've been me..</br>
Is that wrong to think?</br>
I swear I'm not selfish and self-centered.</br>
But why would it be bad if I was anyway?</br>
I deleted the emails about her.</br>
I deleted my bookmarks, my history, my passwords.</br>
I deleted Aidan over and over again in my history.</br>
History repeats itself.</br>
The idea of him keeps raining in my head.</br>
stop. Go away, Aidan.</br>
And silently, he turns around and walks.</br>
And I let him. The pain has a sort of</br>
doppler affect.</br>
It's intense when he's close.</br>
But it dies down when he's far.</br>
But I keep running to him as he runs away.</br>
Getting over him is easier as the days pass.</br>
But.. I don't want to forget him.</br>
But everything about me is.</br>
I'm dying so softly, so politely.</br>
And he's the only one on my mind.</br>
And I'm on my mind.</br>
And I'm growing bigger, choking him out like a house fire.</br>
Aidan is burning down.</br>
My mind is burning down.</br>
I'm the arsonist and the fire-fighter.</br>
The hero, the vigilante.</br>
And Aidan, with no consent, is my accomplice.</br>
And even he is burning away in my fire gloves.</br>
Fire gloves..</br>
He never watered me..</br>
He was hosing me down..</br>
He saw the fire before I did.</br>
Left before he got burned.</br>
And I melted into a puddle of myself</br>
Embarressed and feral.</br>
I'm done writing about him.</br>
Aidan, just die already.</br>
</br>
I wrote while I was walking.</br>
Here are some of those notes:</br>
</br>
I dont think</br>
The friends I made</br>
Will read my filthy book</br>
So i can be filthy</br>
And honest</br>
if only in these</br>
Amateur pages</br>
</br>
I'm a visiting photographer from Aliendia</br>
</br>
I've never been to this world</br>
And my expedition is short</br>
My home will yank me back one day</br>
I should explore more.</br>
</br>
I just want a friend...</br>
</br>
Soft toffy in preschool</br>
Kissing my crush on the cheek like a</br>
creep</br>
He made an octopus out of legos</br>
So shy, so brown, and so sweet</br>
Me - dumb mute and curious</br>
His mother furious</br>
Me playing alone always</br>
Writing love songs</br>
In wood chips</br>
By the only tire swing</br>
Philosopher in 4th grade</br>
Thinking how</br>
I won't really understand life until</br>
I die</br>
</br>
Im scared youll like me</br>
And once you really see inside me</br>
Youll taste me</br>
And throw me away</br>
Like rotten guacomole</br>
That looked good in the package</br>
But is dark green</br>
And gross</br>
</br>
<strong>And</strong></br>
Depression</br>
Chains me to my bed</br>
And out of wedlock</br>
Rapes me and</br>
Keeps the baby</br>
</br>
And that baby</br>
Grows up</br>
And like Odiepus,</br>
That baby rapes me</br>
And hates his father</br>
And he wants me</br>
To keep the baby</br>
To get back at his father</br>
</br>
My womb knots like a web</br>
In the woods</br>
I ran through</br>
And the woods rape me too</br>
And plants a seed</br>
In my broken rock</br>
And waters it every day</br>
Trying to be a father</br>
</br>
I don't know who's further,</br>
The first second or third father,</br>
from deflowering me into a farm</br>
To fucking me</br>
And sucking me</br>
With blank sweat</br>
Figuring out fatherhood</br>
With their manhood</br>
pointed out towards</br>
strawberry fields</br>
And Elysian fields</br>
Paracosm of a freedom</br>
fighter</br>
I guess</br>
</br>
The End.</br>
</br>
I only dance with my shadow</br>
It's black it's red it's yellow</br>
</br>
The only muse I have is myself</br>
Better make it great.</br>
Better not fuck this up.</br>
Better be proud.</br>
</br>
Us youth are so beautiful.</br>
We're just so beautiful.</br>
And everything we do is so beautiful.</br>
The way we eat our food is</br>
So beautiful.</br>
The way kiss is</br>
So fucking beautiful.</br>
Our confusion is so beautiful</br>
Our skin is fresh and soft</br>
Beautiful like moth wings</br>
Our voices are</br>
So beautiful.</br>
Our crying and kissing</br>
Our itching and shitting</br>
The way we break our own hearts</br>
is just so fucking beautiful.</br>
The old don't understand it anymore.</br>
The old just can't understand it anymore.</br>
And that's so beautiful.</br>
That's just so beautiful.</br>
And god,</br>
I'm so beautiful.</br>
And fuck,</br>
You're so beautiful.</br>
</br>
We'll drive coast to coast</br>
On our way to San Junipero</br>
In a custom black jeep</br>
With fur seats</br>
of black sheep</br>
We'll break our bones</br>
And go home</br>
Offline, depressed, and alone.</br>
Distraction, a necessary function.</br>
I'm only sedated with online attention.</br>
Dear,</br>
You're the most twisted tootsie roll</br>
I've ever bitten into.</br>
And I like that.</br>
Honey, I like you.</br>
I like you.</br>
I like you.</br>
</br>
Soft like chewy blue pills</br>
Standing so still</br>
I thought you were roadkill</br>
Every universe you ever entered</br>
sparkled</br>
And every one you left</br>
became a dark age</br>
You are the Pax Romana</br>
of the new world</br>
flossing with harp strings</br>
While I just look at you</br>
standing still</br>
in the middle of nowhere</br>
with everyone and everything slipping</br>
past you. They don't know</br>
They don't see you.</br>
</br>
We squeeze lemons</br>
Till they juice</br>
Throw away the body</br>
of an exhausted fruit</br>
Add sugar</br>
And make lemonade</br>
I think,</br>
maybe enlightened:</br>
How many artists and poets killed themselves yesterday?</br>
</br>
I'm up in the Woods.</br>
I'm down on my mind.</br>
I'm building a still.</br>
To slow down the time.</br>
-Bon Iver</br>
</br>
I wanted you to love me.</br>
But I can't even love myself..</br>
None of this ever seems to work out..</br>
</br>
<p>
  <strong>10/27/2017 12:23am</strong></br>
I can't help but remember us at</br>
fifteen and seventeen. And you</br>
So magically in love with me. Every</br>
Night, I thought about those conversations of</br>
Sex and religion.</br>
I told you the devil was</br>
The most relatable character in the</br>
bible. And you agreed thoughtfully saying,</br>
"I like how you put that. I never thought of</br>
it that way, but it's true."</br>
I think. I can't fully remember. That</br>
was nearly five years ago.</br>
</br>
Having nothing to say is completely okay.</br>
</br>
Today wasn't bad.</br>
Learned about Blade Runner</br>
Robots</br>
Satanism and its beliefs</br>
Life is Strange stuff</br>
And read/made a bit of poems.</br>
Life wasn't bad today.</br>
Living in the moment is best</br>
Scary because time flies that way</br>
But that should be reassuring</br>
There's a light at the end of this</br>
Tunnel. One day, I'll see it</br>
For now, enjoy the fucking tunnel.</br>
</br>
Should stop skipping class...</br>
</br>
Finding out that math is actually kind of fun</br>
(Crazy)</br>
</br>
Happiness, Love, and God have nothing to do with it.</br>
It's the pursuit of happiness</br>
Falling in love</br>
And the search for understanding</br>
That surrounds life and</br>
maybe its purpose too.</br>
</br>
One more thing:</br>
I love you.</br>
Night, loser.</br>
</br>
<strong>10/29/2017 1:38am</strong></br>
I don't know really what to write</br>
I've been thinking of life</br>
In such a fresh way too</br>
It's kind of exciting</br>
Liberating too.</br>
Two beginnings;</br>
The beginning of something more</br>
And beginning to an end</br>
Live life like you've already been reincarnated?</br>
I've read more Anton Levey satanism</br>
I listened to some music.</br>
As usual.</br>
Starting to not like Dashie anymore.</br>
Surprising.</br>
I'm starting to see hope in myself</br>
I'm starting to believe that life is meant</br>
to be lived right now</br>
Not later or for tomorrow.</br>
It's a special feeling</br>
Liberation from self</br>
Like snipping a dying leaf</br>
from a suffering venus flytrap</br>
It hurts to change</br>
But only in the very beginning.</br>
When one really goes for it,</br>
it seems to get better and easier with</br>
time. I like this, I think.</br>
</br>
It feels right.</br>
As I told Aidan,</br>
I've felt so stranded in life.</br>
So alone with rescue seeming hopeless.</br>
Yet, suddenly, the light shone.</br>
The clouds parted</br>
And a helicopter with a swinging ladder</br>
tumbled through to the ground. And I</br>
took hold and now</br>
I'm climbing up.</br>
The height doesn't even scare me.</br>
The what next doesn't even matter.</br>
Anything can happen</br>
No one's completely immune</br>
But I do think one can be safer</br>
Fate seems to have favourites</br>
Those who follow their hearts?</br>
I'm not sure but</br>
my stomach beams with reassurance.</br>
I think listening to the heart</br>
will guide me out of the wilderness</br>
of my mind that I found myself</br>
so hopelessly lost in like</br>
those two hikers who killed themselves</br>
in California.</br>
I won't get stuck and hopeless like them.</br>
No.</br>
I want to keep going</br>
Living is a one time thing</br>
No rehearsals</br>
I should do it my way</br>
Kind of like how Lasha said.</br>
Do things for only myself</br>
Be kind only through my own desire</br>
Which can be manipulated, yeah but</br>
just being both careful and curious.</br>
I can do both I'm learning.</br>
I'm still behind in school</br>
especially that fucking calculus class.</br>
But I'll make it.</br>
I trust my stomach.</br>
I trust fate.</br>
I trust myself.</br>
Just one day at a time.</br>
It's only 24 hours</br>
and I'm asleep for most of them.</br>
Heh.</br>
I feel pretty right now too by the way</br>
I feel..</br>
Desirable.</br>
I feel..</br>
in control.</br>
I feel like..</br>
There's potential in me. That my beauty</br>
is real.</br>
Hm.</br>
I'm interested in wearing more dresses</br>
particularly maxi dresses like</br>
my tyedye one and light blue button up ones.</br>
I like dresses a lot.</br>
Very freeing. Very simple.</br>
I have a choker on.</br>
One I bought early in the year</br>
Like around high school graduation, I think.</br>
It's not bad.</br>
Organized my room a bit.</br>
Found some bubbles from New York.</br>
Blew a few.</br>
All my paperwork is on the floor by my desk.</br>
I decided to toss it all.</br>
I'll sort through it</br>
just not now.</br>
I like red lipstick.</br>
I like glossy lips.</br>
I like neat eyebrows and</br>
long black hair with curly ends.</br>
I like it.</br>
I'm liking this a lot.</br>
I don't even miss family the same</br>
I don't know..</br>
I want to feel bad, and some of me</br>
still does. But, I'm adapting maybe.</br>
Had weird dreams.</br>
As always.</br>
Wrote more poetry</br>
As I tend to.</br>
Thought about my life.</br>
Nothing completely new.</br>
But this is all new for me</br>
Like, a new section of myself</br>
or a new weather system of the same</br>
environment explored.</br>
It's all the same but the way I think and act</br>
towards it is completely new.</br>
And it's cool.</br>
</br>
Something else before I go</br>
I've thought of him again.</br>
Weird dreams about him.</br>
Sometimes he feels like a dream.</br>
Like I made him up.</br>
I feel like Laura Palmer</br>
He haunts me like BOB.</br>
Maybe I'm just acting out</br>
But his affect, I think, is</br>
long-term. I think he won't disappear.</br>
I think maybe it'll take time to</br>
forget him enough</br>
to stop looking for him</br>
every fucking where.</br>
I think so fondly of our past conversations</br>
So sweet to me</br>
In a natural way.</br>
Naturally sweet;</br>
The best kind of sweet.</br>
We never said it outright</br>
we just felt things</br>
and danced around those feelings</br>
I think he understood me</br>
and I think I understood him</br>
at least in those moments together.</br>
It's beautiful to think actually,</br>
What if we end up communicating again</br>
years and years later..</br>
How funny would it be that we both end up</br>
very similar.</br>
If not, very compatible still.</br>
He was a stranger</br>
which made him a great friend</br>
But I think this is best.</br>
To not be with him</br>
Maybe this alone time is what I needed.</br>
In pure desperation in the midst</br>
of foggy depression, very foggy</br>
it was either crack or boil.</br>
And I boiled under pressure</br>
Boiling under pressure</br>
Hoping I become something beautiful.</br>
</br>
<strong>10/31/2017 11:35pm</strong></br>
Life feels okay.</br>
Living in the moment feels a bit scary.</br>
My skin feels different.</br>
Can't explain that now.</br>
Will try later.</br>
I don't feel urgency much anymore.</br>
In the back of my mind,</br>
that seems bad.</br>
Life zips by in a flash</br>
Then it's lost forever.</br>
I get the gift to breathe</br>
knowing one day that gift will need</br>
to be given back.</br>
or maybe away to someone I love.</br>
Children...</br>
Is that why they're born?</br>
To continue on a life that never really got to end(?)</br>
I hope I don't sound pretentious.</br>
I don't feel pretentious.</br>
</br>
I register in about 7 hours.</br>
Spring semester 2018.</br>
Mm.</br>
I'll be taking as follows:</br>
Calculus 2, Physics 1 with lab, computer science 1, and</br>
painting.</br>
I've been eyeing that class for months now.</br>
Need some sort of release.</br>
Diaries and journal art are not enough.</br>
Need something to sustain me, especially with</br>
all these fucking core classes.</br>
I'm a bit panicked, honestly.</br>
Admitting that feels like</br>
a small dam just ruptured inside me.</br>
That's good; that means a weakness is present.</br>
But bad; I now have to handle that.</br>
And all the water damage.</br>
It's not too serious, feeling like this</br>
it's new for me not to be in control.</br>
Isolated and out of control, hm.</br>
Those aren't necessarily bad things.</br>
It feels good.</br>
In a terrible way.</br>
So alone and so lost.</br>
But it's peaceful.</br>
It's peaceful.</br>
And that's new for me.</br>
</br>
I check his page every night.</br>
Sometimes in the morning too.</br>
I care for him the way</br>
a mother may still cherish her</br>
unborn child.</br>
We didn't really have a whole lot</br>
Some good sexual energy</br>
A lot of hot conversation</br>
About life and thoughts that we really</br>
couldn't express to many people, I guess.</br>
I still play his bands.</br>
Not that Cymbals Eats Guitars shit.</br>
Not that.</br>
But I'd listen to that shit if he was in the room.</br>
Hm, those bands are my bands now.</br>
Bon Iver.. Mine.</br>
Yeah, I creeped and found out about the band</br>
after googling the lyrics from his IMVU page.</br>
But I liked it for myself too.</br>
Weird way to find music, but I'm not</br>
complaining at all.</br>
I have a Bon Iver poster in my room</br>
black and white as I type</br>
hanging on my wall by my other posters.</br>
But anyway,</br>
Aidan. Yeah, he's</br>
something.</br>
And every day, I think less and less of him..</br>
And he becomes this</br>
relic to me.</br>
He was already in the past by the way.</br>
I don't hate him.</br>
I think of him when</br>
I think of a really funny idea</br>
that actually makes me laugh out loud.</br>
Of course, in public spaces.</br>
I think of a really clever line</br>
I think of a fantasy where I tell him this</br>
clever line and he laughs or remarks.</br>
All my fantasies center around impressing him.</br>
Or just being with him.</br>
My longing for him is not hot like firewood anymore.</br>
It feels like someone dumped water on our campsite</br>
or my campsite</br>
(He's the woods?)</br>
And that wet smoky wood is</br>
how I feel about him.</br>
Still warm</br>
but now wet.</br>
And soft.</br>
Rotting?</br>
Rotting feels like the wrong word.</br>
But maybe one day, it'll come to that.</br>
Like with all the others.</br>
Aidan's the only one from the past</br>
I think this way about.</br>
Alek is.. gone.</br>
Matthew hurts, but I think about him too a little.</br>
He'd be the perfect satanist.</br>
Handsome fellow.</br>
I can understand why he wouldn't want me.</br>
Shocking how quick he just disgarded me</br>
like literally trash.</br>
Very blunt and sudden.</br>
Shocked me so much</br>
I felt absolutely nothing.</br>
Then anger and embarressment set in.</br>
But I don't feel like typing about that.</br>
The past is gone. He's gone.</br>
I'm older and trying to</br>
figure out what I want to do before I</br>
die or something.</br>
Feel alone, but that's okay.</br>
One day at a time is my rhyme.</br>
Can't go in the future, can't</br>
reset the past.</br>
Just have to go one day at a time</br>
And when it gets hard,</br>
because it always does</br>
I just need to hang in there for one minute.</br>
Then one hour.</br>
And after one hour, I only have 23 more to go.</br>
And I'm asleep for some.</br>
Yeah..</br>
Aidan is still camping out in my head.</br>
I think about him before bed.</br>
Wonder how it would be</br>
if we ever met.</br>
Some people I just have to let go..</br>
And if it was meant to be</br>
What then?</br>
Then, they'll return.</br>
</br>
For now,</br>
I'm trying to focus on myself more.</br>
Speaking less feels better.</br>
I feel high though.</br>
I feel like my thoughts have lost quality.</br>
Ugh.</br>
No order, just chaos.</br>
But I have the time to reorder myself.</br>
I've been dropped in the middle of the ocean</br>
and finding myself</br>
trying to swim in all directions.</br>
I just need to relax.</br.
Enjoy the beauty of the present.</br>
One day, I'll all be over.</br>
I want to live my life</br>
like I already got my second chance.</br>
Reincarnated/Ressurected,</br>
I can't choose which word.</br>
What's so nice is too</br>
is that I don't feel so afraid anymore.</br>
At least in my own skin.</br>
Felt like I constantly had to hide</br>
Wanted to be a ghost</br>
to disappear</br>
but my body wouldn't let me.</br>
Felt shame.</br>
Felt like a misplaced sock</br>
in someone else's laundy.</br>
Not belonging anywhere.</br>
But when I'm living this way,</br>
I don't feel so scared.</br>
It's still there, that fear.</br>
But it doesn't hurt me so much.</br>
Bites maybe.</br>
Like i've caged it and tamed it.</br>
No more feeling like everyone's</br>
inconvenience.</br>
I've also felt like I</br>
should balance this out. I don't</br>
want to suddenly become obnoxious.</br>
I don't want to float through life.</br>
I want to do shit.</br>
I still aim to be deliberate and efficient.</br>
I'm learning.</br>
For now, I'm learning.</br>
Therapy tomorrow at 10am.</br>
I don't know what to say to him.</br>
I can tell him more about my story.</br>
Hope he doesn't push me to group therapy.</br>
I get the feeling he might try.</br>
I'll see.</br>
</br>
Goodnight, fucking loser. <3</br>
</br>
<strong>11/02/2017 11:47pm</strong></br>
Hey.</br>
Today went okay.</br>
I felt the decline again.</br>
But I don't think I fell too hard.</br>
Unlike all the other times.</br>
But it hurts.</br>
It hurts, the reminder of how alone I am.</br>
Hurts. Hurts.</br>
I took my calculus test this morning.</br>
I'm not sure what I got;</br>
I don't even want to give an estimate.</br>
I just hope I got 100 points.</br>
That's how many points I'd need to realistically</br>
pass this fucking class.</br>
I've been wondering about engineering.</br>
I don't want to do that anymore.</br>
I don't.</br>
I don't care about physics.</br>
Math can suck my fucking dick.</br>
Chemistry is boring.</br>
Lab was fun though.</br>
Kind of, at least when I understood what was going on.</br>
Engineering isn't my calling.</br>
I'm going to switch to</br>
a multidiscplinary degree.</br>
I plan to combine information science</br>
and engineering management.</br>
I don't want to be miserable at Truman.</br>
I want to work on art, my writing,</br>
cognitive science, philosophy, psychologu,</br>
and programming.</br>
I feel strongly about this</br>
in a nauseating way.</br>
I'm terrified but relieved.</br>
I dropped my physics class for spring</br>
for a creative writing class.</br>
I feel happy.</br>
Wow, yes.</br>
That makes me happy.</br>
I just spent the last</br>
3 hours working on my schedule</br>
for this idea. Picking the right classes</br>
making sure it can still be completed in two years</br>
mapping out the courses to take at Truman too.</br>
So</br>
Next semester I want to take as follows:
Calc 2, Computer Science, Painting,</br>
and Creative Writing.</br>
Just looking at creative writing excites me.</br>
I better be careful not to</br>
overhype myself for this.</br>
It's just freeing, I suppose.</br>
Very freeing.</br>
But I still feel doubt.</br>
But throwing care to the wind</br>
seems to be my motto lately.</br>
I just don't give a fuck.</br>
Like a nihilist,</br>
The meaning of life seems to be</br>
imaginary like nothing.</br>
So, while I'm here</br>
I should have fucking fun.</br>
Travel, see shit, make money,</br>
Talk to people, fuck up,</br>
Invent, draw, write, whatever.</br>
It doesn't matter.</br>
I know I shouldn't be feeling this pain</br>
especially during college years.</br>
I should enjoy. Be challenged, yes</br>
but enjoy this nonetheless.</br>
</br>
I didn't really go to class.</br>
i was locked out of my dorm since</br>
I lost my key at my career center meeting</br>
yesterday.</br>
I emailed her, "Brandi,"</br>
And she said they found it and had it waiting for me.</br>
I went by after my test, got it, and</br>
hung out at the library for a few hours</br>
reviewing information science and engineering management.</br>
I think:</br>
Remember when I wanted to pursue art at one point?</br>
That's so funny.</br>
Yet also so scary.</br>
Yes, I brushed it aside eventually</br>
But what if this is just another spring of the moment idea?</br>
What if I regret this decision?</br>
What if I find both engineering management</br>
and information science boring?</br>
What if I lose scholarships since I'm not doing engineering anymore?</br>
What if I can't find a job after graduation?</br>
Would I be able to even graduate on time?</br>
I don't know the answers.</br>
I'm scared</br>
but not panicked.</br>
There's a sense of calm washing over me.</br>
Yes, these doubts and fears are legitimate.</br>
But..</br>
It'll be okay.</br>
I know it will because</br>
my stomach says so.</br>
Everything works out when you do what feels right.</br>
And even through the twisting of my stomach</br>
this too feels like it's right for me.</br>
I've been rebelling against fate.</br>
Ignoring my responsibilities</br>
But everyone should stop and reflect</br>
sometimes.</br>
This lapse though,</br>
it wasn't in vain.</br>
I think it's like I've</br>
been hurt, so I'm stopped.</br>
I'm assessing my injuries</br>
I'm slowing down to listen to myself.</br>
And myself is in agnony.</br>
Physically too;</br>
I have a consistent pain in my lower left hip.</br>
I really need to make that appointment.</br>
I feel so fucked up.</br>
Oversleeping and not eating right</br>
is making it worse.</br>
Can't keep hiding in this prison.</br>
Grown to hate my room and bed.</br>
Hate waking up to this fucking reality.</br>
So I'm changing it.</br>
And that's the point of stopping.</br>
To change before you've gone too far off.</br>
</br>
Okay.</br>
I'm tired as fuck.</br>
my roommate is probably sick of me typing so loudly too.</br>
Whatever.</br>
Aidan is still on my mind</br>
blah blah blah</br>
fuck him.</br>
I'm tired.</br>
Goodnight.</br>
</br>
People are afraid to love.</br>
Or maybe they just can't.</br>
</br>
Love it when their heads turn when I speak.</br>
</br>
I seem to have two opposite personalities.</br>
One's chill and innocent.</br>
The other, alert and ruthless.</br>
</br>
<strong>11-5-2017 10:12pm</strong></br>
It fills me</br>
with such hot air</br>
when I find out that he posts something new.</br>
And he has.</br>
Here's a quick link to his Tumblr</br>
<a href="https://impromptuverses.tumblr.com">His Blog</a></br>
How cute, huh?</br>
Yeah. It's sweet.</br>
Spying on him like this</br>
may seem creepy</br>
but I don't feel like a creep.</br>
Not at all.</br>
I feel good when I see that.</br>
A junkie's high.</br>
I hope he continues to write.</br>
I miss hi-no.</br>
I don't know.</br>
I think of him, yes.</br>
I reflect on him endearingly.</br>
I know he'll be okay.</br>
I gave him my email just in case.</br>
But I doubt he'll pursue me.</br>
Uhmm</br>
I haven't checked that email.</br>
....</br>
One moment.</br>
Nothing.</br>
Nothing at all in fact.</br>
Aidan's gone.</br>
But still a sweet memory.</br>
The others are so bitter.</br>
One day, maybe he'll be bitter to me.</br>
When I find someone new.</br>
..</br>
</br>
The country is falling apart.</br>
So many mass shootings.</br>
So much craziness and insanity.</br>
The idea that life can end in an instant</br>
is so real, so validated.</br>
Hate the news.</br>
Can't safely check Yahoo without</br>
it appearing on the first page though.</br>
Maybe I can disable it?</br>
I'd have to sort through online solutions.</br>
Not now.</br>
I want to talk about other things.</br>
</br>
My fall from happiness was not too harsh.</br>
I survived.</br>
I'm still down in the dumps.</br>
But like bug spray</br>
I pulled out my trusty ideology</br>
to repel the evil forces of my mind.</br>
It's relieving to call them what they really are.</br>
Evil.</br>
They hurt me.</br>
Yes, everything posesses new understandings.</br>
But some things yield nothing but</br>
dead ends and more pain.</br>
I don't want that anymore.</br>
I don't want to wander through the caves</br>
of self</br>
just to fucking get hurt more.</br>
Nothing will come out of this</br>
self-inflicted torture.</br>
Torture I put myself through.</br>
No one else does this to me more</br>
than myself.</br>
I need to fight this inner evil.</br>
Sometimes I can't even trust that side.</br>
Not everything about myself</br>
wants me to win.</br>
There's an inner universal desire</br>
for man to hurt themselves.</br>
And everything else in this fucking world.</br>
I can't give in.</br>
The pain is too much.</br>
The reward is useless misery.</br>
So, I stop.</br>
Yes.</br>
Fuck this shit.</br>
I'm done with being so hurt and alone.</br>
Maybe loneliness will take some time</br>
to resolve, but this cracking hurt</br>
can be helped.</br>
Yes. There's potential here.</br>
In me.</br>
The ideology that comes to my rescue</br>
during these deep dark times</br>
is when I put myself first</br>
I treat myself with care</br>
I live life with the attitude</br>
of a comfortable and daring</br>
INDIVIDUALIST</br>
Heh.</br>
I don't write in all caps.</br>
Another example of pointless</br>
self-restraint.</br>
No more. No more.</br>
My mother rules do not apply.</br>
I don't have to only survive anymore.</br>
I don't have to put the ideas of others</br>
and the feelings of others</br>
and their situations first anymore.</br>
I'm alone now.</br>
The only one in my mind is me.</br>
Right?</br>
I get so pumped up</br>
only to fall so hard.</br>
And that scares me.</br>
I regret old statements.</br>
I regret old actions.</br>
I think I'm stupid</br>
Immature.</br>
When I'm angry, I find my past kindess to be wasted.</br>
When I'm happy, I'm inspired to help others.</br>
I don't know.</br>
Feels like I'm being pulled in all directions</br>
I don't know which self to obey.</br>
I may just rip apart completely.</br>
I don't know.</br>
I feel fear.</br>
I feel unsure.</br>
But somehow,</br>
I feel empowered sometimes too.</br>
Like, when I listen to loud music</br>
walking on the sidewalk passing strangers.</br>
Their weird looks or no looks at all</br>
they don't bother me so much.</br>
And when I dress weird,</br>
Like in ankle-length dresses</br>
And shit like that</br>
I don't feel so fucked up.</br>
I feel out of place here though.</br>
Still DEEPLY hate having a roommmate.</br>
Fucking hate it.</br>
But..</br>
Even in this room</br>
I feel a bit more liberty</br>
by removing these self-imposed rules</br>
about the "right" conduct to assume</br>
when she's here.</br>
when anyone's here.</br>
and my personality feels so constipated.</br>
I need to express myself.</br>
But, it's hard.</br>
Hm.</br>
I think in painting and creative writing</br>
I'll have that chance.</br>
Yeah..</br>
</br>
Reading his posts fills me with this</br>
hope that christians must feel</br>
when they go to church.</br>
It's like seeing a plane in the distance</br>
when you're stranded on an island of yourself.</br>
I don't wave for rescue anymore.</br>
I just admire that.</br>
</br>
I got some shit I wrote:</br>
(I also changed the background of tablet</br>
will link pic.)</br>
</br>
Sorry. I won't post my</br>
recent writings now.</br>
my fucking head feels cracked.</br>
like some snake slithered up there</br>
and then bit my left side.</br>
jaw is locking up.</br>
maybe it's too much technology.</br>
hate my body</br>
acts like an old car.</br>
Goodnight.</br>
</br>
<strong>11/9/2017 9:54pm</strong></br>
I just finished crying about</br>
ten minutes ago.</br>
Felt..</br>
I don't know.</br>
Afraid of the unknown</br>
Want to make sense</br>
but find myself not making any.</br>
and as a pun, I'm broke too.</br>
I guess crying is good.</br>
Been feeling so trapped in myself.</br>
So trapped.</br>
Like an illiterate person</br>
lost in a world of words</br>
I don't understand.</br>
I feel so alone.</br>
I can't stress it enough.</br>
My support system is myself.</br>
And it's rocky.</br>
The same nightmare</br>
Huh..</br>
Went to that first-gen student dinner</br>
yesterday. Food wasn't bad.</br>
I came for a free meal.</br>
So I could start saving up my</br>
meal points to save food for</br>
thanksgiving break</br>
since I'll be staying on campus.</br>
And I learned that the dining halls are closed.</br>
So, need to save some extra stuff</br>
like apples.</br>
like microwave meals.</br>
I'm a real college student now.</br>
So, the dinner wasn't bad.</br>
Of course,</br>
high school scence of</br>
"loner girl sits alone and group of</br>
preppy girls tell her she can sit with them."</br>
I went ahead.</br>
Didn't say much to them</br>
I don't remember saying much at all.</br>
Then, we got a table leader.</br>
An academic advisor</br>
and an unexpected guest.</br>
the president of the university herself.</br>
Right next to me on my left.</br>
Felt like shit that I wasn't willing</br>
to speak very much.</br>
They seemed patient though.</br>
I started opening up at those two</br>
were kind and seemed genuine.</br>
They asked us how it felt to a</br>
first generation college student.</br>
We went around the table.</br>
Girls said their peice.</br>
I mentioned the lack of diversity</br>
and trying to find somewhere to fit into.</br>
Then, they asked what are some ways</br>
we can all fix wanting to belong.</br>
And the girls said that</br>
a person needs to get out and just make friends</br>
and not stay to themselves.</br>
And make an effort because it's on them.</br>
When it came to me, I just said, "Nothing."</br>
I shut down.</br>
I didn't want to connect anymore.</br>
I heard enough and felt my cue.</br>
I was an inconvenience for the whole table.</br>
And no, this isn't fucking made up.</br>
I know they were saying that indirectly to me.</br>
Fuck those girls..</br>
No one gets it..</br>
</br>
I didn't let the above ruin me.</br>
I just continued on.</br>
I stopped going to math class.</br>
We have a quiz over two chapters</br>
Probably will fail that.</br>
I want to laugh to relieve the melancholy.</br>
But no laugh fits here.</br>
That's probably just out of old habits</br>
Noticing how depressing I come off</br>
to others</br>
and learning to curve it somewhere else.</br>
Back in my head.</br>
I hate calculus..</br>
I don't want to try anymore.</br>
Wasn't doing any doing in that class.</br>
Just a bunch of trying..</br>
Some crying</br>
Deep sigh.</br>
Feel so alone.</br>
Everyday's the same day</br>
and I know, I need to stop whining</br>
just change it for the better.</br>
Reinvent myself.</br>
I'm trying.</br>
This is the first time</br>
I've really been like this.</br>
Hmm, in high school, at least 9th grade</br>
I didn't care either.</br>
I just trudged through</br>
Didn't see the point of school</br>
didn't care about getting a D</br>
just let me pass the fucking class.</br>
I mean, I had fun sometimes too then.</br>
But was still very apathetic.</br>
A lot of pent-up emotions like now</br>
Feeling like I just want to kill everybody</br>
all these stupid clones.</br>
hate them all.</br>
Understanding terrorists and school shooters</br>
Maybe they just want to be heard?</br>
For once?</br>
yeah.</br>
I get that completely.</br>
</br>
Checked his stuff.</br>
He posted something else.</br>
He linked his tumblr on IMVU too.</br>
Who knows, Aidan may become a published author/poet.</br>
And I'm here crying over him.</br>
Like a little girl</br>
a little little girl.</br>
smallest little girl, yes.</br>
My brain feels like mush.</br>
I feel hated by people.</br>
No respect. Like a disgusting bug on the wall</br>
Everyone trying to mash me.</br>
I don't know..</br>
People might think I'm paranoid.</br>
But I feel it.</br>
That I'm annoying</br>
my opinions are unwanted and attacked.</br>
I'm not in the inside group.</br>
I'm the outsider with bug legs.</br>
That Kafka guy. Yes, like Metamorphis.</br>
If that's how you spell it.</br>
Probably not.</br>
Don't care about anything.</br>
Just trying to get out of this</br>
alive. Trying to survive this.</br>
That's all.</br>
Live Through this,</br>
that's all.</br>
</br>
Cried so hard, I made sound.</br>
Weeping moans.</br>
Then I started laughing</br>
I don't know why.</br>
Short circuit?</br>
I don't know why.</br>
It felt weird.</br>
</br>
no more words.</br>
WE'RE CLOSED</br>
COME BACK SOME OTHER TIME</br>
</br>
Oh wait.</br>
Let me tell you.</br>
In bed last night, I was just laying there.</br>
And suddenly I got the idea for the cover</br>
for Happy Normal.</br>
It's beautiful.</br>
Really beautiful.</br>
I sketched it on my tablet.</br>
Maybe I can post it here.</br>
It's beautiful.</br>
It's perfect.</br>
</br>
<strong>11/11/2017 11:12pm</strong></br>
Here I am.</br>
Drifting in space.</br>
Listening to Lana Del Rey's</br>
"Fine China."</br>
(I think I have a gluten allergy. fucking stomach discomfort.)</br>
I read some of my old journals.</br>
The blue one with gold designs</br>
and the gold one with a bunch of colours.</br>
It was nice.</br>
Younger me is still like current me.</br>
So real, she's so real.</br>
She existed once.</br>
A nice echo of myself.</br>
Experiencing pain and confusion</br>
Loneliness and despair.</br>
Weird dreams and exciting things too.</br>
I'm still myself</br>
but this college shit is repressing me.</br>
I don't know what I want anymore.</br>
I'm considering a multidisciplinary degree now.</br>
Engineering management and information science and technology.</br>
Don't know what I'll do with that.</br>
I just want to write, be involved in game dev, and</br>
work on projects that impart meaning to me.</br>
even if that meaning is extrinic in the end.</br>
The end.. that's why I'm listening to this song.</br>
I read it one of my journals.</br>
Younger me liked this song too.</br>
Makes me think:</br>
I'll die only when I have</br>
fine china and fresh linen.</br>
and most of my dresses have tags still in them.</br>
whites horses and ivory almonds.</br>
Mm. These things, materials sure</br>
but they have meaning to me</br>
secretly because I did it to prove a point.</br>
To myself that I can achieve what I want.</br>
Despite all this temporary sadness and defeat.</br>
despite wanting to drop out nearly every second.</br>
That sadness is there to prove a point</br>
That we all control this reality</br>
I'm gonna die anyway, right?</br>
might as well be free.</br>
even if it's just a feeling in the moment.</br>
Those moments matter. They make all the differnce.</br>
I don't want to be sad anymore.</br>
All emotions are like biological symptoms</br>
something's wrong or something's right.</br>
So, sadness is like hunger</br>
It wants us to seek something fufilling.</br>
When I went down to the radio club</br>
I felt a taste of fufillment</br>
I went outside in the cold, my enemy</br>
and walked to the station in the dark.</br>
no technology, just curriculum sheets for the</br>
multidisciplinary program.</br>
Felt good, I think.</br>
Nothing special though.</br>
But everytime I go in, I</br>
love to just sit there in the music</br>
with no one around</br>
and when I take on-air breaks</br>
I like to experiment with my delivery</br>
or choose the ads I'll say.</br>
Or just rock my head otherwise.</br>
That on its own feels good.</br>
Today, I spoke to someone just a little</br>
Named Colton</br>
Him and one of the heads were going to cut in early</br>
for my show to set up a broadcast.</br>
I didn't mind. They were chill.</br>
And I didn't feel bad for not trying to be cool</br>
and considerate.</br>
I just responded in the moment</br>
acted in the moment</br>
and it's a simple experience</br>
but all the memorable things are.</br>
And I like that memory.</br>
Highlight of my week?</br>
Pathetic really, but I'm okay with that.</br>
No need in being safe, older me.</br>
No need in that.</br>
I need to listen to my mental state</br>
and act accordingly.</br>
I've been feeling a lingering depression</br>
like the flu, just over my head all day like a</br>
rain cloud.</br>
And I'm just taking it.</br>
But no more.</br>
I've locked myself into a closet</br>
of pure ignorance</br>
by rejecting everything, every possible solution.</br>
No more of that.</br>
No more judging things before I actually try it</br>
Or I may find my foot in my mouth.</br>
I can live in the moment</br>
but that doesn't require participation</br>
for the sake of knowing I did.</br>
Some of the best things are experienced silently.</br>
Nothing forced.</br>
Organic, you know.</br>
Like at the radio station.</br>
Imperfect moments feel sometimes just right.</br>
The world isn't empty.</br>
I feel so ignorant.</br>
Like a know-it-all, I think I've seen it all.</br>
But no, I haven't even entered it yet.</br>
Not a big taste either</br>
A little lick, that's all.</br>
Touching my tongue to it</br>
and sliding down.</br>
Falling off the surface of something so massive.</br>
By my own will of ignorance.</br>
I don't need to be just right.</br>
But that doesn't mean I shouldn't present</br>
what I think is my best.</br>
No more hiding</br>
And no more careless mistakes either.</br>
Carefree and poise, they can exist as one</br>
force for freedom.</br>
I don't have to be ditzy and dumb</br>
And I don't have to be all-knowing and restrained.</br>
Just do what feels right, logically and emotionally.</br>
And no more caring about what others think.</br>
It's weird,</br>
I have no friends, literally, and I still care about</br>
the opinions of random strangers.</br>
Those fuckers probably don't even notice me.</br>
So, I should explore this</br>
Be free and non-judegemental of anything or anyone</br>
Including me.</br>
</br>
All these things are so poetic.</br>
It seems like it makes sense.</br>
But I know I'll fail.</br>
I don't say that cynically.</br>
But I know me.</br>
It takes a while for something to stick.</br>
These are big changes.</br>
But I know they're doable.</br>
And I know they're necessary.</br>
'Cause I'm rotting away now.</br.
Fucked up my calc 1 quiz.</br>
have to bring up my game now.</br>
The fucking semester is almost over, the hell?<br>
I can't give up.</br>
I can't just stop.</br>
It's hard.</br>
</br>
With this ritual, I will write about him too.</br>
Aidan still exists in the</br>
ocean of my mind.</br>
But he's floating away</br>
Don't reach out for him either</br>
Just watch him go farther and farther</br>
in awe maybe. I don't know.</br>
I check his Tumblr.</br>
As always, wonderful.</br>
He's wonderful.</br>
I love his writing.</br>
They always fill me something new.</br>
Like being brought back to life</br>
with the shock of a defibrillator.</br>
It's nice</br>
having him as a memory.</br>
There's so many people in this world</br>
7.4 billion</br>
People like him,</br>
And people like me</br>
exist.</br>
He's not the only wonderful thing about life.</br>
And as he drifts out of sight,</br>
that seems more true.</br>
There's more to this life than worrying</br>
and stressing and regretting</br>
and wondering and hoping.</br>
I'm not chasing rainbows anymore.</br>
They don't exist.</br>
It's time look at myself</br>
And take a more stable direction</br>
instead of being frozen in indecision</br>
waiting for a helping hand.</br>
That fantasy is burning</br>
And I can't do anything.</br>
That's okay.</br>
I'm not expected to be a wise superhero.</br>
Every sage was once a fool</br>
Otherwise their wisdom is somewhat lacking</br>
of a certain substance obtained</br>
by actively living life and really learning.</br>
I don't have to get burned to know</br>
the dangers of fire</br>
Other people can do that for me.</br>
But I should get close</br>
To at least get a sense of it.</br>
I need more experiences.</br>
</br>
Do you want me to write more, older me?</br>
Because I can.</br>
Part of me wants to stop</br>
Part of me wants to keep going.</br>
Maybe that's why I'm so still.</br>
This fucking tug of war shit</br>
is killing me.</br>
Go to class or sleep in?</br>
Go out with friends I found</br>
Or neglect them?</br>
Message Ten back?</br>
Or leave her be?</br>
Going through an ignorant rebuttle</br>
from both sides that end in me</br>
doing nothing or taking the easier way out.</br>
I'm not brave.</br>
I'm lazy. I'm pathetic. I'm fat.</br>
I need to stop with this complaining shit.</br>
Look.</br>
Life won't magically get better</br>
especially with this fucking attitude.</br>
It's hard.</br>
But it's not hard to email someone back</br>
or go for a walk even when it's 40 degrees outside.</br>
If I can find time to watch Jacksepticeye</br>
or masturbate multiple times a day,</br>
I can go to a class that starts at 7:30am</br>
I can brush my teeth</br>
I can go to a college art exhibit</br>
I can pay my bills</br>
And I can take care of any of these problems</br>
While I have so much fucking downtime.</br>
I think about how stupid and empty other people are</br>
But that's pure arrogance.</br>
They try a lot more than me.</br>
I don't have the right to be sad so much.</br>
I don't.</br>
I may not have family, but that was my decision to cut them.</br>
I may not have friends, but I don't go out and make them.</br>
I may have low self-esteem, but I overeat.</br>
And I don't excersize.</br>
I just sit in this fucking chair</br>
and on this fucking laptop.</br>
I downloaded Unity</br>
I've downloded Unreal Engine 4</br>
I have a Choose Your Story account</br>
but I don't go on Youtube to learn how</br>
to use them.</br>
Because I'm afraid of failture</br>
when all I do is preach about how failure is</br>
not something to fear at all.</br>
But I fear it.</br>
I fear it.</br>
I hate being alone.</br>
I hate how good Aidan's writing is</br>
how ridiculous I feel when I write.</br>
but my fucking life is not his.</br>
I can change this.</br>
Instead of always doing literally nothing</br>
waking up and experiencing the same day</br>
over and over</br>
listening to the <strong>same</strong> songs</br>
and the <strong>same</strong> Youtube videos.</br>
Thinking of the <strong>same</strong> movies</br>
and old books</br>
NO</br>
I can change this.</br>
Otherwise, the only person who gave up on me</br>
not momma, not the tlp, not familly, not henry,</br>
not aidan or james, or alek, or matthew,</br>
not talaiha, not michael</br>
not my dad</br>
but me.</br>
I'm giving up on myself here.</br>
My younger self would be ashamed</br>
By my total appearance</br>
my mental image of pure laziness</br>
and my physical image of lack of control</br>
when I stuff myself to the point of aching.</br>
No more, H__</br>
no more. Please.</br>
I can't keep doing this.</br>
I'm married to myself</br>
And I can't break my vows.</br>
So, all I can do is change.</br>
Please change. PLEASE.</br>
</br>
I'm done.</br>
I'll see what happens next week.</br>

<strong>11/22/2017 12:06am</strong></br>
I've been laying here thinking</br>
of all sorts of things.</br>
It's Thanksgiving break.</br>
The Halls feel like literal ghost towns.</br>
So silent as I peruse through.</br>
A bit creepy, a bit nice.</br>
I try not to think too much about this.</br>
I went and got Chinese earlier in the afternoon.</br>
Wore my wig and red lipstick from Dollar General.</br>
Felt a bit beautiful.</br>
I woke up so late. I've been waking up</br>
so late lately.</br>
I'm doing weird things.</br>
Like sleeping on the floor</br>
in the middle of my dorm room.</br>
Just for the sake of doing something differently.</br>
Just for the sake of not experiencing the same</br>
day over and over again with very slight</br>
differences, like what YouTube video I watch</br>
what time I shower</br>
what clothes do I wear.</br>
It's mundane</br>
But not in a negative way.</br>
Deep sigh.</br>
It's like a slice of life story.</br>
Starring me, the girl of the century.</br>
Me alone with my thoughts and duties.</br>
like math homework.</br>
I got my appeal denied.</br>
I guess I'm getting an F now.</br>
I don't even care though.</br>
I do. But it pisses me off to such a deafening point.</br>
I feel calm.</br>
I like this alone time.</br>
I'm still frightened</br>
but I started talking to myself.</br>
Like, out loud.</br>
It feels... nice.</br>
No one to share these thoughts with.</br>
These randomly erupting thoughts.</br>
I have literally no friends.</br>
Ten emailed me back.</br>
Strange how at first,</br>
my stomach twisted into a pretzel</br>
now, I feel so little about it</br>
with traces of guilt.</br>
Sorry Ten.</br>
I don't know what's happening to me.</br>
I feel like I'm bursting out of a caccoon</br>
Like I'm a slave about to run away</br>
And I'm so close to escaping</br>
It feels so good</br>
I can't look back now.</br>
It'll sabotage everything.</br>
I feel like I'm doing that myself though</br>
Like I'm sabotaging my future.</br>
Momma told me in the car</br>
as she drove me to greyhound</br>
we had parked at QuikTrip?</br>
She told met that one day I'll find myself all alone.</br>
No one will help me.</br>
No one may want to.</br>
I listened silently but broke down in tears.</br>
I can't say why.</br>
But it just happened.</br>
And that was before dad too.</br>
Dad threw me out.</br>
I don't feel very wanted by my family.</br>
I know they love me.</br>
But they don't really know me?</br>
I'm trying to know who I am</br>
Who I actually am</br>
independently.</br>
I can't have anyone around anymore.</br>
Everyone just gets in the way.</br>
That's why I'm doing this.</br>
I need to walk on my own two legs now.</br>
I depended on people too much.</br>
I feel like if</br>
I can pull through this,</br>
I have finally broken past</br>
my need for validation from others.</br>
And have replaced that need with the need</br>
to love myself as I learn myself all by myself.</br>
I had a nightmare of Halina.</br>
He found us again, but he wanted her specifically.</br>
I kept hiding her in obscure places</br>
like in the trunk of a car</br>
or a trailer bathroom of a grandmother of theirs.</br>
I would make up stories to get him to leave</br>
and we'd escape again.</br>
I woke up very frightened.</br>
I'm scared for them.</br>
I'm so scared for them.</br>
I couldn't handle anything bad happening to them</br>
especially since I basically abandoned them.</br>
I feel so bad.</br>
I just want to reach for my tablet</br>
And let them know how much I love them.</br>
How much I miss them.</br>
But it's a pattern of mine.</br>
I get like this.</br>
I get so worried, I jump back into their mess.</br>
And I feel unwanted by them or used for money.</br>
I don't know anymore..</br>
I don't know what to do.</br>
I read their local news</br>
to check for any crimes in their area.</br>
It fills me with guilt and fear.</br>
I can't wait until he's dead</br>
then maybe I'll have peace for once.</br>
God.</br>
God...</br>
The world is crazy</br>
And I'm all alone.</br>
All the open doors lead me to pain and repression</br>
All the doors I want to go through are locked.</br>
The only door I have maybe is</br>
one into myself.</br>
And if I can unlock that one</br>
It'll be my master key for my future.</br>
I just need to pull through.</br>
Yeah..</br>
I can do that.</br>
All alone.</br>
So alone.</br>
But now the depression sometimes misses me when it swings.</br>
I got better at ducking.</br>
Feel myself getting stuck down here though.</br>
Getting comfortable as a victim.</br>
Don't like that.</br>
This has been a rough semester, damn it.</br>
Broke and failing my classes.</br>
Pissed off and restless.</br>
So restless.</br>
But I have these cuffs of fear</br>
That I feel were placed by my past.</br>
That's why I need to be alone.</br>
The key will appear from within</br>
at some point.</br>
if I just shut up and listen.</br>
If I take ownership for my current situation</br>
and the direction I'm headed.</br>
I can steer myself out of this mess.</br>
I need to act fast.</br>
I need to get used to acting on my own commands.</br>
I'm so used to thinking but not enough doing.</br>
I can survive this like all that other shit.</br>
Emotional, physical, spiritual too I guess.</br>
Just got to do.</br>
Something, anything.</br>
Write that fucking book, lose this fucking weight</br>
maintain my scholarship, and prepare for Australia.</br>
Because I am getting accepted into UTS.</br>
I fucking promise, h.</br>
I fucking promise.</br>
One more thing.</br>
I went a whole day without looking for him.</br>
Aidan.. he's exiting.</br>
He's taking his exit.</br>
It's been a month surprisingly.</br>
But he's finally leaving.</br>
I still thought of him throughout the day.</br>
I fantasize about things I'd say if we were in a group chat together.</br>
I think about him. I think about Des too.</br>
I think about family.</br>
All these people.</br>
I'm nostalgic and I miss everyone.</br>
I wish I had some love.</br>
But love isn't contained in mere words, h.</br>
Love is animated.</br>
I can love myself</br>
when I put on makeup in the morning and do my eyebrows</br>
when I clean my bed so I can sleep more comfortably</br>
when I download a good song for me to listen to</br>
when the internet is down.</br>
I can love myself by showing myself.</br>
Aidan could never do that, he was an online friend.</br>
That's all he'll ever be.</br>
Even when I go to Australia,</br>
we're most likely not going to meet.</br>
As much as I'd like to.</br>
To know who he really is,.</br>
That's one of my dreams, I guess.</br>
Miss that boy.</br>
Miss his kind words and his personality.</br>
Miss him.</br>
But I need to bury him like he buried me.</br>
And move on like I am with family</br>
for the same reasons.</br>
Deep Sigh.</br>
I'm going to check his site.</br>
..He posted something about breaking bad.</br>
Don't know what it means.</br>
Won't pretend I do.</br>
He's a different person now.</br>
I loved him when he was 17.</br>
And maybe that's mostly it.</br>
...</br>
I don't want to end this note on him.</br>
Fuck him.</br>
Fuck family..</br>
Fuck everyone.</br>
I don't say that angrily.</br>
It's sad really.</br>
I know that I'm an individual</br>
and no one will ever connect to me.</br>
That I need to learn how to take care of myself.</br>
Let me repeat to show how important that line is:</br>
<strong>That I need to learn how to take care of myself.</strong></br>
I have to build myself.</br>
For more money</br>
for more freedom.</br>
I can't make any promises, older me.</br>
I'll only disappoint you.</br>
And you know that.</br>
But I believe in you</br>
Just like the girl earlier this year</br>
who wrote on the last page of a journal</br>
how scared she was of changing</br>
but how much she still believed in herself</br>
to do the right thing</br>
to do right by herself</br>
in a world of mirrors</br>
that distort you</br>
and break you</br>
but the reflection is still the same after all.</br>
I trust you, older me.</br>
I trust that even during this wild furlough</br>
of intense solitude</br>
that you and I will pull through.</br>
I believe in myself.</br>
I believe in myself, I do.</br>
Even though other people don't seem to get me</br>
I can keep on.</br>
And I can get me.</br>
At least most of me.</br>
And when I'm free,</br>
I won't need their validation.</br>
They'll admire me. I'll have fun with them.</br>
And I'll move on to elsewhere</br>
Because I'm free.</br>
I'm not free in college right now.</br>
I'm in prison. I'm melancholic.</br>
I'm on the verge of giving up completely</br>
passively.</br>
But if I can drag myself to the finish line</br>
I can do anything that comes next.</br>
Even if I fail,</br>
I still love and want to understand myself.</br>
This is a vow, h.</br>
I promise to love you unconditionally</br>
like dad and aidan couldn't.</br>
That no matter how hard I fall,</br>
no matter how stupid and beat I feel and probably am,</br>
I'll get up and do it again differently.</br>
Try a new approach.</br>
But I won't stay down and blame the world.</br>
I don't know where to start exactly.</br>
There's no manual for living my life.</br>
I have to create one from scratch</br>
as a life story.</br>
And I'm doing that now.</br>
With this thing.</br>
God..</br>
This is.. scary.</br>
I need all the faith I have.</br>
But I know I can do it.</br>
No one can be me better than me, right?</br>
Right.</br>
So, I need to teach myself.</br>
I need to stop distracting myself with food</br>
and with the internet.</br>
I need to learn and read more.</br>
And pop the bubble I'm hiding in.</br>
Just a little bit at a time though.</br>
Enough that I can still move forward</br>
when things go to shit</br>
'cause they always do.</br>
Heh..</br>
I'll get sad again.</br>
But read these words, h.</br>
I swear I believe I can make it to my dreams.</br>
Please don't give up and kill yourself.</br>
Please keep pushing.</br>
And please, for the love of life itself,</br>
do those fucking scholarships.</br>
Okay?</br>
Good night. (I'm smirking.)</br>
</br>
<strong>About 15 minutes later</strong></br>
Oh yeah,</br>
I'm taking a theatre class now next semester.</br>
Makes me happy just to type that.</br>
</br>
<strong>11/25/2017 12:12am</strong></br>
I read his blog again.</br>
Something about coca cola and suicide.</br>
I guess it's summer over there.</br>
It's been a full month</br>
Felt so much longer than that though.</br>
Been feeling like it's been forever</br>
Since I last messaged him.</br>
Hey, he didn't message me back either.</br>
Asked for one reply before I went off.</br>
No reply.</br>
And I went on a rampage</br>
fueled by his rejection.</br>
I'm so cold and alone</br>
Icy cold sensations in my stomach</br>
Like I'm supposed to be feeling something</br>
that isn't there.</br>
But I'm burning up inside too</br>
I have this big ass green jacket on</br>
I feel cold without it though.</br>
Hmm..</br>
You know, he's building a fan base.</br>
He's going to be well-known one day</br>
Like an Indian beyonce who writes poetry</br>
about suburbia, suicide, and random memories.</br>
I've been trying to pull away.</br>
I really have been trying to</br>
focus only on myself.</br>
So alone here..</br>
The Halls will refill with students soon.</br>
Probably sunday afternoon.</br>
I heard some people coming in already Friday</br>
I don't like that but I do?</br>
I wrote on their little whiteboards</br>
on their doors</br>
Words like, "SCREAM"</br>
And terms like, "HAPPY, ALWAYS HAPPY"</br>
Felt good..</br>
I've been studying for calc 1 too, h.</br>
You'd be proud.</br>
I want to get that C.</br>
I need to get a C to qualify for my full </br>
second-year scholarship.</br>
I don't know how this will work out.</br>
I don't.. know.</br>
I haven't spoken to another human being for so long.</br>
No conversations. Only with the therapist.</br>
Some conversations about ordering food</br>
about choosing classes for next semester</br>
etc.</br>
Nothing real.</br>
No messages, no holiday surprises.</br>
It could make me sad but I don't cry about it.</br>
I just sit here.</br>
Watching youtube and listening to music</br>
and stupidly fantasizing about him.</br>
I hold onto anything of him.</br>
Makes me sick.</br>
Gives me this icy hot knotty anxiety.</br>
Like how I felt about James</br>
when Joanna would message me saying that</br>
she was sleeping with him and she was having his kid.</br>
I was only a kid back then myself.</br>
James was my age now.</br>
7 big years of a difference at least.</br>
Needed some love</br>
Found some by the dumpster</br>
Desperate as always.</br>
Surviving as always.</br>
I still think of James too.</br>
</br>
I wrote some poems</br>
</br>
"You traded me in for a spot at the cool kids' table.</br>
I sit alone now at the table of losers.</br>
I still keep your seat warm.</br>
I take turns switching seats just in case</br>
you decide to come back to me.</br>
Meanwhile, I eat my lunch packed in brown paper bag.</br>
Meanwhile, I think you started smoking weed and getting</br>
frisked by sexual divas.</br>
That's what you wanted,</br>
something that felt good and made you feel like you</br>
belonged somewhere.</br>
I'm chained to this table of losers.</br>
My chains are stringed with pearls of optimism,</br>
the optimism that one day, you'll take a break</br>
and have lunch with me like old times.</br>
I know I have to stop living in the past, old friend.</br>
I know that regardless of if you come back or not,</br>
your character has changed.</br>
or was revealed.</br>
or was completely killed off and replaced by a new actor.</br>
I flance at the cool kids' club and try to see you,</br>
but all I see is a blur of the same person.</br>
I can't make you out as easily anymore.</br>
If you ever come back, I know I'll feel bitter.</br>
My lunch sandwich can no longer nullify the</br>
taste of abandonment.</br>
I, too, need to abandon this table of now one loser.</br>
I can't keep waiting on you.</br>
You're not even my friend anymore, old friend.</br>
It's time to throw away my lunch,</br>
wipe up all these old crumbs,</br>
and unchain myself.</br>
Maybe if I walk far away from you and your club,</br>
I'll never think about you again.</br>
But I know that's a lie.</br>
</br>
I'll post some more some time later.</br>
I wrote that this morning.</br>
My mind was on him</br>
As if he was sleeping right next to me.</br>
I know I kee saying it,</br>
but I'm so alone.</br>
It's like chronic pain</br>
The feeling will never go away.</br>
But I can do something to distract myself.</br>
I'm lost sometimes.</br>
I know I need to get back up and keep moving.</br>
But I've never been this alone ever in my life.</br>
I literally have no one.</br>
No one who gets it.</br>
No one to hang out with.</br>
No one to call.</br>
No one at all.</br>
I either fly or die..</br>
And me looking at Aidan's blog,</br>
just adds weights to my wings</br>
but it gets me writing.</br>
It adds fuel to my fire.</br>
I think we always were that way with eachother.</br>
It's like some sort of silent competition.</br>
I always felt it.</br>
But never brought it up.</br>
It wasn't significant nor important.</br>
..</br>
So yeah.</br>
I'm sad.</br>
But not sad.</br>
I'm numbed up</br>
but I've been that way so it's nothing new.</br>
Just get me through this semester, h.</br>
This is pure terror.</br>
Plus, the new year is approaching.</br>
And that is my worst time of year</br>
just naturally.</br>
I'm too nostalgic.</br>
I'm too sentimental.</br>
I look back too much while walking forward</br>
running and bumping into things.</br>
Gotta stop that. Gotta.. stop that.</br>
The old is the old.</br>
But it's so intriguing to me.</br>
I don't know why I can't stop analyzing it.</br>
Stop, h.</br>
Please.</br>
I find myself begging myself more and more.</br>
I know these bad habits hurt me.</br>
I know I'm just wasting time.</br>
I know I'm just trying to put off my responsibilities</br>
and dreams.</br>
But I'm learning something</br>
When I finally start something new</br>
it feels good.</br>
I need to keep doing that.</br>
Just start.</br>
Just jump in.</br>
I make up my excuses, I try to get out of doing this</br>
but just doing it feels good.</br>
Even if it's just math homework</br>
or working on another scholarship</br>
or watching a short film on youtube from Jesse</br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WyDjXSLg88</br>
just something new.</br>
Baby steps into the unknown,</br>
into the future and out the nest of the past.</br>
Aidan is missing out on me.</br>
I'm learning how to be beautiful</br>
without anyone.</br>
I'm learning how to have courage.</br>
It's taking forever but I feel progress.</br>
I'm losing weight too.</br>
I'm down to 167llbs.</br>
I want to be 165 by next week.</br>
Don't have to accept my current situation.</br>
Don't have to hide in shame.</br>
I can be myself without that.</br>
It's so new..</br>
But it's good to learn this now</br>
to practice this now</br>
then to grow old like dad</br>
and suddenly realize how much I missed out.</br>
No, I don't want that.</br>
I gotta do better.</br>
I believe in myself.</br>
Truth is:</br>
Aidan abandoned me.</br>
My family is unstable</br>
I have no friends and I don't give people a chance anymore.</br>
I don't understand intimacy.</br>
I'm ignorant, I'm naive of reality and how the world works.</br>
But I have grit. I have good strategy.</br>
Lots of ideas, a lot of them don't live though.</br>
And no one reads my stupid blog.</br>
I'm free here.</br>
to say whatever the fuck I want.</br>
So, fuck you Aidan.</br>
FUCK YOU.</br>
I gotta push you out.</br>
I can't do it lightly either.</br>
FUCK YOU AIDAN</BR>
I'm all on my own.</br>
No one checks up.</br>
No one supports.</br>
Ten emails me but I don't feel so strong to her.</br>
Out ship is leaking?</br>
and instead of being so hopeful</br>
I need to learn when to abort.</br>
And I'm doing that.</br>
I'm aborting this life of mine.</br>
I'm running away from the things that hurt me</br>
confuse and manipulate me</br>
misunderstand me</br>
use me and abandon me</br>
They already left me though.</br>
I'm just now accepting it for myself..</br>
</br>
I feel like New York is calling me.</br>
I feel like I'll visit somewhere else.</br>
I'm stuck in this small city.</br>
No cars.</br>
But seeing those videos and vlogs, I know</br>
that there's more to the world than this shit.</br>
I'm not meant to die in such a box.</br>
There's an adventure calling me.</br>
I feel it like a baby in my belly.</br>
It's growing and as I grow older,</br>
the reality will happen and the opportunity will appear.</br>
I just need to prepare for it now.</br>
Take up this time to prepare.</br>
I feel it..</br>
I'm getting out of here</br>
I'm living in the name of myself..</br>
And I'll remember me during these times.</br>
I'll remember these people who gave up on me.</br>
And the people who understood me.</br>
I don't owe anyone but myself.</br>
No one gets a peice</br>
I'm in incubation</br>
it's cold, I'm alone, I'm lonely</br>
I'm scared, I'm sad, I feel trapped.</br>
I'm a baby, so vulnerable and ugly.</br>
But watch this baby bloom.</br>
Don't give up.</br>
</br>
IT'S NOT THE END UNTIL I LITERALLY DIE</br>
</br>
A lot of sweet talk for sweet me from sweet me.</br>
Here's something that made me cry just now:</br>
"Can you just leave me the fuck alone?</br>
I don't want to be your friend.</br>
God, just fuck off already.</br>
Go. Leave me alone, dumbass.</br>
Fucking idiot."</br>
I think of that..</br>
They're saying that to me</br>
And I'm so shocked and so naive</br>
that tears drop past an open smile</br>
and walk away slowly</br>
trying to pretend that didn't happen</br>
frozen on the inside</br>
It's so common, the rejection</br>
that it leaves me feeling nothing.</br>
it's as normal as the wind</br>
Just accept what just happened and walk like nothing happened.</br>
haha</br>
hurts me but I have to get used to it.</br>
Laugh it off</br>
And accept that people</br>
just.. I'm not wanted by anyone.</br>
unless for sex or money.</br>
Use me like candy and throw away my wrapper</br>
dismissed and tossed.</br>
I pull myself out of the dumpster</br>
and feel nothing</br>
but typical tears</br>
and wanting to explode</br>
but I have class and jobs</br>
or a visit somewhere</br>
and I just need to bite my arm and wipe my eyes</br>
and smile in the mirror</br>
so when they see me, I look sweet enough.</br>
to listen to them talk</br>
with dead eyes covered by brown contact lenses</br>
and when they fade off</br>
I spin and force myself to sleep</br>
twitching numbly</br>
as I wake up to do it</br>
all over again.</br>
every day</br>
The end.</br>
</br>
fuck you h for reading his stupid fucking blog</br>
</br>
<strong>11/28/2017 8:55pm</strong></br>
Read his shit</br>
Time to write a poem</br>
</br>
"Everybody loves him.</br>
He's cryptic</br>
I'm clumsy like Courtney Love</br>
dying to be a superstar</br>
in his unwanted spotlight</br>
I know he likes it.</br>
but he never smiles"</br>
</br>
"Trying to fill in the blanks to seem</br>
resourceful</br>
forcing unknowns out of the dark</br>
so they can say I'm clever</br>
</br>
Shaking my hips in the sun for ice cream</br>
they sit back and laugh quietly at me</br>
Let go of my hand when I start to cling</br>
Sufforcate me when I want to breathe</br>
Let me go when I want to leave</br>
They don't care about me</br>
but they all love him."</br>
</br>
"Jealousy is just love and hate at the same time."</br>
But I'm not jealous?</br>
