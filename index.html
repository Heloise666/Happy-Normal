    <strong>10/16/2017</strong></br>
Plant a seed and water it everyday.</br>
Some seeds don't germinate, so</br>
plant more.</br>
(I feel good today. I feel the high but my feet feel the abyss I'm re-approaching.</br>
I'm scared of falling again from these high heights.)
</p>

<p>
  <strong>10/18/2017</strong></br>
He's gone.</br>
Like everyone else,</br>
he's gone.</br>
I gave him my email just in case he needed me.</br>
He won't need me. This I know.</br>
Waited for his final response to my final response literally all night.</br>
I didn't sleep. I slept in, missing all my classes.</br>
Maybe that was dumb. But I did it.</br>
It's midterm break and everyone has deserted campus.</br>
Even my roommate. I'm so relieved to have this space all to myself.<br>
Finally.</br>
I feel like he never really wanted to change this or put in more effort.<br>
I was a guaranteed stock. He wasn't required to do much.</br>
But that was the fucking point.</br>
You have the option to show how much you care.</br>
And you cared so little, I had to pretend you really did.</br>
What else can I say to you after this?</br>
As soon as I brought up disbanding,</br>
You were already a mile away.</br>
How do you live life hurting people?</br>
No warning or anything. You just take what you want and get out.</br>
Don't say you're guilty when you keep doing it.</br>
One day, things will flip.</br>
You'll be the one hurt and confused</br>
Not by me, but by someone you trusted.</br>
so much it might kill you..</br>
Everything comes full circle.</br>
I just wish you would understand.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>10/18/2017 Nighttime</strong></br>
  I want to kill myself.</br>
I feel like suicide is the only option. I've tried, I've tried.</br>
But I can't keep trying and crying all the time.</br>
My life has been nothing but pain. In all areas, there's mostly painful memories.</br>
Molested by Henry's friend when I was about 5. He'd slap me around afterwards.</br>
Thought it was love in a way.</br>
Isolated by momma.</br>
Brian beating us, beating our mom, beating Henry with a sword that night</br>
It's too much for one person.</br>
Feeling manipulated by my mom. Feeling so sheltered.</br>
I felt like the world was this scary place that only had bad intentions.</br>
I was ashamed of my family. I was ashamed of myself.</br>
I didn't go to friends' birthday parties.</br>
I want to make up these great memories my mom keeps trying to make seem real.</br>
Dad hit me and busted my lip on holloween.</br>
I had to leave a year later as a homeless kid.</br>
Friends at school were few. I turned to online.</br>
And even then, I knew I wasn't worth much to those people.</br>
Not to James, not to Des, not to Dianna, not to Sara, not to Tea,</br>
Not Sora, not Luke, not Katrina, not Rayne, Jake, Shanti..</br>
Not Aidan. Not Lasha. Not Alek. Not Matthew.</br>
they disappeared.</br>
I'm tired of crying. I'm tired of rejection. I'm tired of feeling worthless.</br>
I'm tired, I'm tired.</br>
I'm just ready to die. I don't want to be here anymore.</br>
It'll just be a life of pain.</br>
They're all gone. Family. They don't understand. They don't help.</br>
They just hurt and blame.</br>
Tough love is not what I need right now. I give myself enough of that.</br>
I'm tired, I'm tired.</br>
I hate school. I hate Truman. I hate this. I hate this life. I hate this.</br>
I can't stop thinking of killing myself.</br>
I just want to sleep forever.</br>
I can't keep waking up in this body.</br>
I can't do this. I can't do this alone</br>
But I have no one. They're gone.</br>
I'm alone now.</br>
I just need the courage. Some weed to loosen me up like that night with Ten.</br>
I want to die like Taylor Wheat.</br>
I want to join my grandmother.</br>
Kill me.. Please. Kill me. End this.</br>
I have no one... no one...
</p>
<p>
  <strong>10/19/2017 1:47am</strong></br>
I meant all of that above.</br>
I want this pain to be over.</br>
No one will ever see this, so I can be honest here.</br>
I wish someone could see this and save me.</br>
I think it's cute that I always talk about helping people in similar mindsets</br>
But in reality, I'm hoping someone will see I'm talking about me.</br>
So far, no takers.</br>
Can I be angry at the world?</br>
Because I am. I hate this place. I fucking hate everyone.</br>
They charm. They take. They cripple. They leave.</br>
I hate this world. I don't care if I don't understand it.</br>
I hate this world. I hate living here. I hate feeling so alien.</br>
I'm ugly, black, short, and fat. My genes are unlucky.</br>
My brain is big and taxing.</br>
My energy is exhausted easily, socially and physically.</br>
I think that types like me weren't meant to make it in the world/wild.</br>
We're below everyone else. We're meant to die off.</br>
But here I am. Breathing and typing. My tears are drying to my face.</br>
I'm tired but I'm afraid to get off this keyboard.</br>
I'm afraid I'll have to face myself and my loneliness all alone all over again.</br>
I need distractions. So, I'll watch Dashie, since he makes me laugh.</br>
And I'll try to fall asleep before I notice.</br>
</br>
I deleted kik, so I don't know if Aidan ever messaged me back.</br>
I guess I'll find out later.</br>
I don't even feel like I'm living for later.</br>
It's hard enough to exist in this moment.</br>
Is this how my hermit crabs felt when they commited suicide one by one?</br>
Such terrible cold conditions. They started leaving their shells, dying.</br>
They were that desperate to ease their discomfort.</br>
And I feel that. I feel that.</br>
Lisa is so relatable.

  <strong>10/19/2017 9:49pm</strong></br>
Hi.</br>
I'm sitting here at my laptop.</br>
Light blue dress that comes to my ankles and buttons up.</br>
Short sleeves. Looks nice on me.</br>
I have a black jacket on. Michael's jacket. A bit bigger but not much.</br>
I'm a fat girl. I'm a short girl. I'm confused about things.</br>
I try to feel pretty but I don't feel pretty.</br>
I want to change though. Before I go through with any suicide,</br>
I want to at least feel beautiful.</br>
And at the end of that journey, if I still feel miserable,</br>
I then know that none of this was avoidable. That my feelings are chronic.</br>
I slept in until around 4pm. Wow.</br>
I haven't wasted that much time in one sitting before.</br>
I think about him. I do. I read my messages that I screenshot.</br>
I think of things I should have said instead or worded differently.</br>
I wonder how he's taking those messages. If this even bothers him.</br>
If this is hurting him as much as it hurts me.</br>
And I don't know what would feel better.</br>
To know this is hurting him or that he's okay?</br>
It's selfish, I know.</br>
But the yearn for validation can be so strong.</br>
I feel numb but okay. I think.</br>
I tried to hate the world, but I don't hate it.</br>
I tried to think tough thoughts, to be strong.</br>
I don't feel very strong. I feel numb.</br>
I got some Dairy Queen. That's all I ate today.</br>
I don't feel fat, but it was still fattening.</br>
I watched a little bit of old 2013 Dashie vids.</br>
I played two games from <a href="https://itch.io">Itch.o</a></br>
<a href="https://zephyo.itch.io/i-woke-up">I woke up next to you again</a></br>
And <a href="https://the-quinnspiracy.itch.io/depressionquest">Depression Quest</a></br>
The first game was really short.</br>
Probably took me 30 minutes to see all the endings.</br>
Depression Quest, however, took me forever.</br>
I just finished it before this post.</br>
Made me think of him. Maybe that's how he felt.</br>
Guilty, sad, and de-energized all the time.</br>
It made me think about my choice of words in that final message.</br>
I felt regret.</br>
But the choice still remains. I had to leave.</br>
Two sad people can't lift each other out of the wilderness.</br>
It's too fucking hard. Too much. Too fast.</br>
But I hope my email served some purpose. I check it.</br>
In the back of my mind, I'm stuffing down the hope</br>
that he does end up needing me and reaching out.</br>
It bubbles up inside me and I'm popping the hope as it comes.</br>
Hopelessness or constant disappointment?</br>
I don't know.</br>
</br>
No one reads this. I can be honest here.</br>
I have to keep reminding myself.</br>
I'm scared to be found out.</br>
But no one will find this. I'm a ghost.</br<
Stranded and forgotten.</br>
No one will see this. Be honest.</br>
I have to relax. For once, I have to relax.</br>
Have to trust this medium of expression</br>
since I don't have anything as useful.</br>
I have therapy tomorrow at 11am.</br>
I don't really like my therapist. He gets me so wrong.</br>
I cried in his office and he just stared right through me.</br>
I know they're probably use to people crying, but I don't know.</br>
I felt unseen?</br>
So, that's that. I will keep going though. I need appointments.</br>
They keep me on some sort of accountability schedule.</br>
Plus, venting is always good.</br>
When I see him, I'm going to tell him</br>
that I no longer want to discuss my social difficulties.</br>
I want to focus on getting over my past.</br>
Getting comfortable with who I am.</br>
I want to focus on myself. I'm not ready for people.</br>
I can't focus on the world anymore.</br>
Dad even said it once:</br>
"Stop trying to understand people all the time. Understand yourself."</br>
I use psychology and good observation to</br>
monitor others in a way, I guess.</br>
But that's to avoid myself?</br>
I need to stop worrying about others.</br>
I need to get comfortable with myself.</br>
As he said, put myself first.</br>
Even in the end, he let me down gently.</br>
</br>
I wrote something on my phone this morning too.</br>
It was during that long sleep. </br>
I had woken up around 12 and started typing this sort of manifesto.</br>
It was about.. well, all of this. </br>
I'd have to copy and paste it here sometime.</br>
I really liked it.</br>
The main takeaway I got was that</br>
I need to take this life one day at a time.</br>
Get over Aidan one day at a time.</br>
Get over what my family has done to me one day at a time.</br>
Go to tutoring. Go to class. One day at a time.</br>
Commit to my diet one day a time.</br>
Commit to consistent hygiene one day at a time.</br>
Speaking of which, I need to shower.</br>
God, the residence halls are so empty. </br>
It's fucking bliss walking through the hallways.</br>
My roommate got a letter slid in under our door.</br>
She was nominated SA.</br>
I'm thinking of shredding it and playing dumb.</br>
It feels so good but it's so bad.</br>
It doesn't feel bad but to the person who finds this</br>
and is reading, maybe they think it's bad.</br>
But I want to do it.</br>
I snooped through her belongings.</br>
I read her shitty writing.</br>
I laid in her bed.</br>
So, that's what the other side feels like?</br>
Parents sending you letters of love and encouragement.</br>
Drawings from friends on your desk.</br>
Coffee mugs and fedoras. Pictures of recognizable people.</br>
Money. Lesbian books. Desk lamps.</br>
I'm shredding that fucking letter.</br>
Am I jealous? Is this jealously? I don't want to admit it.</br>
I feel something though.</br>
And it feels so good burning lightly in my chest.</br>
I don't want her to hurt like me. No, that's not what's going on.</br>
But having control over someone else's life feels good.</br>
To be on other side, for a change, feels good.</br>
And I'll do it amorally. With small traces of shame and guilt.</br>
But I'll do it.</br>
Anyway, I need to take that shower. My head hurts. I feel stupid.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>10/21/2017 1:42am</strong></br>
I don't want to live anymore</br>
Just want to fly fly fly fly away</br>
Ride high on the wings to paradise</br>
  Fly fly fly high and away
</p>
<p>
  Went to therapy like I promised myself.</br>
Felt good actually.</br>
I took it slow with him.</br>
He started talking about my loneliness and lack of friends.</br>
I said I didn't want to talk about that anymore.</br>
I wanted to talk about my past.</br>
I wanted to finally express all these memories.</br>
And we did that.</br>
I cried at some things. I managed through others.</br>
And it wasn't predictable either.</br>
The tears fell whenever like they were their own people.</br>
Dying on my face in that little office.</br>
Told him about Brian.</br>
Told him about moving constantly.</br>
Told him about Henry and that night.</br>
Told him about momma and feeling like I had to keep a low profile.</br>
Told him these little bits and peices about me.</br>
These things that seem so worthless to me in my head.</br>
But I think of them everyday?</br>
I guess these things are important to me after all.</br>
I'm coming out the closet, world.</br>
Believe it or not, I have a personality.</br>
I don't have to cower in a corner.</br>
Or be ashamed of myself.</br>
Just taking it one day at a time.</br>
The days matter.</br>
Can't keep sacrificing these days for the big picture.</br>
They make up the big picture.</br>
Just one day at a time.</br>
Slowly learning how to speak honestly.</br>
Slowly unlearning how to restrict myself from basic emotions.</br>
It's okay to be angry sometimes. To be jealous. To hate.</br>
It's okay to feel hurt, rejected, disrespected, and pathetic.</br>
My feelings won't go away because I ignore them.</br>
No matter how hard I push.</br>
They're still there, even farther out of my reach now.</br>
Just one day at a time.</br>
And when just getting through the day seems impossible,</br>
I'll take it one minute at a time. Just one minute.</br>
Breathe. I have to remember to breathe. To accept myself.</br>
My family and old friends aren't here anymore.</br>
I don't have to be what I think they want me to be anymore.</br>
My mask doesn't have to be removed now,</br>
but deconstructed.</br>
One peice at a time.</br>
As I go through metamorphosis,</br>
my mask, the caccoon, breaks slowly.</br>
Like an egg shell.</br>
</br>
I still check his Tumblr and IMVU page.</br>
I still wonder.</br>
I want to type answers here.</br>
I want to explain my behaviour with some wise insights</br>
and relevations. Offer some sense to my future self.</br>
But I don't know what to say.</br>
I just do what I do.</br>
There's no pure reason.</br>
And as terrifying (honestly) the unknown is for me,</br>
It's starting to surround me like</br>
family members at my death bed in a hospital.</br>
The unknown mourns my dying self.</br>
But I'm not dying.</br>
The hollowed closet I turned my being into is being torn down.</br>
To make room for the unknown me.</br>
I've been trying on these different personas</br>
Trying to figure out which fits best.</br>
Be cruel like a trap rapper? Heartless and money-oriented?</br>
Be cool, confused, beautiful, and young like Tame Impala and Lana Del Rey?</br>
Be a narcissistic robot like Marina and the Diamonds?</br>
Angry like Dance Gavin Dance?</br>
Powerful and confident like Beyonce?</br>
Soft and poetic like Imogen Heap and My Brightest Diamond?</br>
Who do I choose to become?</br>
I'm more lost than I like to admit.</br>
I like to seem in control.</br>
If I play like I'm well, I'll get well, right?</br>
These suicidal feelings are telling me that I'm wrong.</br>
And I don't like being wrong. Ever.</br>
Maybe I really am a know-it-all, like Ten said.</br>
Dad said the same.</br>
And here I am. Alone.</br>
I didn't take that shower last night.</br>
I continued trying to fix this site more.</br>
I'm satisfied for now.</br>
(Just typing the above scares me. I'm waiting for the worse now.)</br>
I had brown discharge this morning. Like blackish.</br>
My sides have been hurting for months.</br>
I don't have health insurance, so I don't want to get checked.</br>
But maybe I should at least find something to check me up.</br>
I don't want anymore pain.</br>
One last thing:</br>
I played Life is Strange, Before the Storm. Episode 2.</br>
Just finished before writing.</br>
Liked it a lot.</br>
Rachel Amber scares me admittingly though.</br>
I don't trust her.. I don't know.</br>
Stomach feels sick. Gotta go.</br>
</br>
Just one day at a time.</br>
That's all.
</p>
<p>
  Guess my personality type.
  That's right - INTJ!
  The loneliest of them all!
</p>
<p>
  <strong>10/23/2017 12:22am</strong></br>
Here I am.</br>
Sitting in my usual spot in my room.</br>
Fall break is officially over.</br>
I want to die already.</br>
My sleep is off. It's terrible.</br>
Dreams are still weird.</br>
Just because I declared a change</br>
doesn't mean a change will occur suddenly.</br>
It's all a long process.</br>
I feel sick. Sicker than normal.</br>
Like my stomach will erupt.</br>
I eat everything in one sitting and don't consume</br>
all my recommended calories.</br>
I ate like shit all week.</br>
I barely bathed.</br>
Didn't bother brushing my teeth.</br>
That felt liberating.</br>
But I'm going to change that.</br>
I'm taking a shower soon.</br>
Going to wear clean clothes for class.</br>
Going to be a good clean girl.</br>
</br>
I still feel ill.</br>
Both mentally and physically.</br>
My habits of overthinking,</br>
Being overly aware of others,</br>
Being unable to live in the moment</br>
Without my thoughts wandering endlessly</br>
Thinking of Aidan.</br>
It hurts to check his feeds</br>
But out of boredom and bad habits</br>
I still do.</br>
I miss him.</br>
I miss having a friend.</br>
Even if that friend disappeared for weeks.</br>
Tried to reassure myself.</br>
Would tell Ten that our bond was relaxed and special.</br>
We had freedom together.</br>
But that was a cover-up for the fact</br>
That he would leave without much consideration.</br>
And I would message him repeatedly for a response.</br>
Was he only my friend out of sympathy?</br>
A sympathetic shell - Aidan.</br>
Gone already a mile when I brought up leaving.</br>
He's been on IMVU.</br>
He hasn't responded to my messages on Kik,</br>
So, I deleted it.</br>
Another program I deleted because of hin.</br>
Mathew...</br>
Alek..</br>
They've all left me.</br>
And I'm all alone now.</br>
Feeling suicidal</br>
So dark and empty.</br>
Pretty canvas for makeup and music.</br>
Music, Youtube, writing the book, college -</br>
Only things I have now.</br>
Out of everything, the only things I own are the things I do myself.</br>
It hurts to feel nothing still.</br>
I'm hoping that things get better.</br>
I'm hoping this sad spirit leaves me alone.</br>
If sadness was a lover, we'd have a family together.</br>
And sadness would never cheat on me.</br>
No, sadness never strays. Always loyal. Always with me.</br>
Did you know that about 3000 people kill themselves each night in the US?</br>
I just researched that this morning.</br>
One day, I feel like I'll be in that group.</br>
At least I won't go to hell alone.</br>
</br>
Time for that shower.</br>
I'm sure my roommate is tired of my late night stirrings.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>10/25/2017 10:05pm</strong></br>
Here I am again.</br>
Another night of dirty dancing.</br>
I'm not dancing, just sitting.</br>
I went out for a walk.</br>
Needed that badly.</br>
Felt like my head was going to explode.</br>
My sides feel like they're burning.</br>
The pain is briefly lifted when I eat.</br>
How nice.</br>
My head still hurts.</br>
Suicide is still a lingering thought.</br>
I think of death every morning,</br>
Nearly every minute really.</br>
I feel bad.</br>
I feel scared.</br>
I feel like I'm going to do something</br>
stupid.</br>
But the thought of doing something</br>
is exciting enough for me.</br>
I'm ready to fuck up.</br>
I'm ready to smash, kill, and fail.</br>
I want to feel real pain</br>
That has real purpose and meaning.</br>
All this pain is meaningless, boring, gloomy, and deep.</br>
Cuts me like a slow knife.</br>
Just take a chainsaw to my jaw.</br>
Just fucking do it already, fuck.</br>
I'm so hurt, so numb</br>
I don't want to be special or golden.</br>
Special like a mentally retarded child.</br>
Golden like a shower.</br>
Pointless little ant - me.</br>
One out of 7.4 billion.</br>
All these beautiful people.</br>
And their beautiful problems.</br>
My words spill and mix like cereal and milk.</br>
The cafeteria doesn't serve cookie crisps anymore.</br>
I have to eat fruitloops or cheerios now.</br>
A blank bowl stares back at me while I eat.</br>
And all that chatter pitter patter blows right past me.</br>
And I don't care about the blurry faces anymore.</br>
Some girl died from my college.</br>
I saw the email. That girl is super dead.</br>
Could've been me..</br>
Is that wrong to think?</br>
I swear I'm not selfish and self-centered.</br>
But why would it be bad if I was anyway></br>
I deleted the emails about her.</br>
I deleted my bookmarks, my history, my passwords.</br>
I deleted Aidan over and over again in my history.</br>
History repeats itself.</br>
The idea of him keeps raining in my head.</br>
stop. Go away, Aidan.</br>
And silently, he turns around and walks.</br>
And I let him. The pain has a sort of</br>
doppler affect.</br>
It's intense when he's close.</br>
But it dies down when he's far.</br>
But I keep running to him as he runs away.</br>
Getting over him is easier as the days pass.</br>
But.. I don't want to forget him.</br>
But everything about me is.</br>
I'm dying so softly, so politely.</br>
And he's the only one on my mind.</br>
And I'm on my mind.</br>
And I'm growing bigger, choking him out like a house fire.</br>
Aidan is burning down.</br>
My mind is burning down.</br>
I'm the arsonist and the fire-fighter.</br>
The hero, the vigilante.</br>
And Aidan, with no consent, is my accomplice.</br>
And even he is burning away in my fire gloves.</br>
Fire gloves..</br>
He never watered me..</br>
He was hosing me down..</br>
He saw the fire before I did.</br>
Left before he got burned.</br>
And I melted into a puddle of myself</br>
Embarressed and feral.</br>
I'm done writing about him.</br>
Aidan, just die already.</br>
</br>
I wrote while I was walking.</br>
Here are some of those notes:</br>
</br>
I dont think</br>
The friends I make</br>
Will read my filthy book</br>
So i can be filthy</br>
And honest</br>
if only in these</br>
Amateur pages</br>
</br>
I'm a visiting photographer from Aliendia</br>
</br>
I've never been to this world</br>
And my expedition is short</br>
My home will yank me back one day</br>
I should explore more.</br>
</br>
I just want a friend...</br>
</br>
Soft toffy in preschool</br>
Kissing my crush on the cheek like a</br>
creep</br>
He made an octopus out of legos</br>
So shy, so brown, and so sweet</br>
Me - dumb mute and curious</br>
His mother furious</br>
Me playing alone always</br>
Writing love songs</br>
In wood chips</br>
By the only tire swing</br>
Philosopher in 4th grade</br>
Thinking how</br>
I won't really understand life until</br>
I die</br>
</br>
Im scared youll like me</br>
And once you really see inside me</br>
Youll taste me</br>
And throw me away</br>
Like rotten guacomole</br>
That looked good in the package</br>
But is dark green</br>
And gross</br>
</br>
<strong>And</strong></br>
Depression</br>
Chains me to my bed</br>
And out of wedlock</br>
Rapes me and</br>
Keeps the baby</br>
</br>
And that baby</br>
Grows up</br>
And like Odiepus,</br>
That baby rapes me</br>
And hates his father</br>
And he wants me</br>
To keep the baby</br>
To get back at his father</br>
</br>
My womb knots like a web</br>
In the woods</br>
I ran through</br>
And the woods rape me too</br>
And plants a seed</br>
In my broken rock</br>
And waters it every day</br>
Trying to be a father</br>
</br>
I don't know who's further,</br>
The first second or third father,</br>
from deflowering me into a farm</br>
To fucking me</br>
And sucking me</br>
With blank sweat</br>
Figuring out fatherhood</br>
With their manhood</br>
pointed out towards</br>
strawberry fields</br>
And Elysian fields</br>
Paracosm of a freedom</br>
fighter</br>
I guess</br>
</br>
The End.</br>
</br>
I only dance with my shadow</br>
It's black it's red it's yellow</br>
</br>
The only muse I have is myself</br>
Better make it great.</br>
Better not fuck this up.</br>
Better be proud.</br>
</br>
Us youth are so beautiful.</br>
We're just so beautiful.</br>
And everything we do is so beautiful.</br>
The way we eat our food is</br>
So beautiful.</br>
The way kiss is</br>
So fucking beautiful.</br>
Our confusion is so beautiful</br>
Our skin is fresh and soft</br>
Beautiful like moth wings</br>
Our voices are</br>
So beautiful.</br>
Our crying and kissing</br>
Our itching and shitting</br>
Our screenplays and effortless wandering is</br>
Just so fucking beautiful.</br>
The old don't understand it anymore.</br>
The old just can't understand it anymore.</br>
And that's so beautiful.</br>
That's just so beautiful.</br>
And god,</br>
I'm so beautiful.</br>
And fuck,</br>
You're so beautiful.</br>
</br>
We'll drive coast to coast</br>
Like this is San Junipero</br>
In a custom black jeep</br>
With fur seats</br>
Of black sheep</br>
We'll break our bones</br>
And go home</br>
Depressed and offline.</br>
Not distracted, making us dangerous.</br>
You're the most twisted tootsie roll</br>
I've ever bitten.</br>
And I like that.</br>
Honey, I like you.</br>
I like you.</br>
I like you.</br>
