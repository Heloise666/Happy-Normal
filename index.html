    I really like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=grunge+gifs+vhs">VHS grunge gifs</a>, and <a href="https://google.com/search?q=mother+mother">music</a>.

    <strong>10/16/2017</strong></br>
Plant a seed and water it everyday.</br>
Some seeds don't germinate, so</br>
plant more.</br>
(I feel good today. I feel the high but my feet feel the abyss I'm re-approaching.</br>
I'm scared of falling again from these high heights.)
</p>

<p>
  <strong>10/18/2017</strong></br>
He's gone.</br>
Like everyone else,</br>
he's gone.</br>
I gave him my email just in case he needed me.</br>
He won't need me. This I know.</br>
Waited for his final response to my final response literally all night.</br>
I didn't sleep. I slept in, missing all my classes.</br>
Maybe that was dumb. But I did it.</br>
It's midterm break and everyone has deserted campus.</br>
Even my roommate. I'm so relieved to have this space all to myself.<br>
Finally.</br>
I feel like he never really wanted to change this or put in more effort.<br>
I was a guaranteed stock. He wasn't required to do much.</br>
But that was the fucking point.</br>
You have the option to show how much you care.</br>
And you cared so little, I had to pretend you really did.</br>
What else can I say to you after this?</br>
As soon as I brought up disbanding,</br>
You were already a mile away.</br>
How do you live life hurting people?</br>
No warning or anything. You just take what you want and get out.</br>
Don't say you're guilty when you keep doing it.</br>
One day, things will flip.</br>
You'll be the one hurt and confused</br>
Not by me, but by someone you trusted.</br>
so much it might kill you..</br>
Everything comes full circle.</br>
I just wish you would understand.
</p>
<p>
  I want to kill myself.</br>
I feel like suicide is the only option. I've tried, I've tried.</br>
But I can't keep trying and crying all the time.</br>
My life has been nothing but pain. In all areas, there's mostly painful memories.</br>
Molested by Henry's friend when I was about 5. He'd slap me around afterwards.</br>
Thought it was love in a way.</br>
Isolated by momma.</br>
Brian beating us, beating our mom, beating Henry with a sword that night</br>
It's too much for one person.</br>
Feeling manipulated by my mom. Feeling so sheltered.</br>
I felt like the world was this scary place that only had bad intentions.</br>
I was ashamed of my family. I was ashamed of myself.</br>
I didn't go to friends' birthday parties.</br>
I want to make up these great memories my mom keeps trying to make seem real.</br>
Dad hit me and busted my lip on holloween.</br>
I had to leave a year later as a homeless kid.</br>
Friends at school were few. I turned to online.</br>
And even then, I knew I wasn't worth much to those people.</br>
Not to James, not to Des, not to Dianna, not to Sara, not to Tea,</br>
Not Sora, not Luke, not Katrina, not Rayne, Jake, Shanti..</br>
Not Aidan. Not Lasha. Not Alek. Not Matthew.</br>
they disappeared.</br>
I'm tired of crying. I'm tired of rejection. I'm tired of feeling worthless.</br>
I'm tired, I'm tired.</br>
I'm just ready to die. I don't want to be here anymore.</br>
It'll just be a life of pain.</br>
They're all gone. Family. They don't understand. They don't help.</br>
They just hurt and blame.</br>
Tough love is not what I need right now. I give myself enough of that.</br>
I'm tired, I'm tired.</br>
I hate school. I hate Truman. I hate this. I hate this life. I hate this.</br>
I can't stop thinking of killing myself.</br>
I just want to sleep forever.</br>
I can't keep waking up in this body.</br>
I can't do this. I can't do this alone</br>
But I have no one. They're gone.</br>
I'm alone now.</br>
I just need the courage. Some weed to loosen me up like that night with Ten.</br>
I want to die like Taylor Wheat.</br>
I want to join my grandmother.</br>
Kill me.. Please. Kill me. End this.</br>
I have no one... no one...
